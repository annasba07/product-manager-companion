Human beings learn specific skills over time. To excel in a skill, one has to be good at figuring out things and getting them done, but how can someone be good at a craft, especially if it is new? Want to find out? Let’s dive into the article.What is Natural Learning (NL)?Natural Learning is an intuitive process through which a person learns from the activities that happen in their day-to-day life.When a kid is born, they are pretty new to the world; walking, speaking, and eating won’t come as naturally as the older ones. But as time progresses, the kid develops this sense of picking up on the activities and soon becomes good at doing them. How? All thanks to natural learning abilities.My experiences with Natural Learning:I was in high school when my relationship with coding began. First, I started learning C and C++; back then, the resources were very scarce. Having a computer/laptop at home was sporadic, unlike now. So the first instinct that kicked in was to use my natural reasoning and arithmetic abilities to build the intuition for learning programming languages. Later, when I started learning java, it became easy for me to pick up the skill and practice it later in my life.As I advanced into my Bachelor’s, I was fascinated with an open-source document preparation system called LaTeX. Back then, I used it to modify pdf documentation. All we need to do for formatting is to provide the required string in a specific format for the text to display/change in the document. It was fun and educational.Years later, my close friend and colleague at work asked me if I wanted to pursue an IoT project that could improve productivity at work. I promised that I would act as a product manager for the entire time of the project. While we progressed, we ended up in a situation where we had little time at hand, and we needed to build a user interface to show the map of the rooms and their availability. We decided to develop a UI that displays the map with information on room availability could be so appealing for a brand-new product, but the challenge is that it will take more time to create an exact map.I asked myself how I could do this within the stipulated time ?; the first instinct that occurred to me was to break down the problem into smaller pieces and then work the way up to the solution, which I did and ended up with two sub-problems:Displaying the map.Updating the map dynamically.Considering my history of working with pdfs using LaTeX, I realized an accurate map with the exact location of the meeting rooms could be extracted from a pdf and then displayed utilizing javascript. Once the map is rendered it can be updated using jquery and ajax. We put the solution together and delivered the project, which was a huge success. Thanks to the skills that I picked through natural learning.Practicing Natural learning:Although Natural learning is an intuitive process, one should be keen to grasp knowledge from the presented opportunity. Otherwise, intuition could become obsolete. Here are some ways you could practice your Natural Learning:Be curiousHuman civilization couldn’t have progressed without curiosity; imagine what would have happened if Newton was not so interested in the apple that fell on his head; we could have ended up not understanding the concept of universal gravity. Similarly, try being curious about the ideas that interest you.2. Learn from past experiencesLook back at your experiences and try to understand for yourself what could have been better. Then, ask yourself questions to unravel hidden answers from the experiences.3. Challenge yourselfDon’t miss out on opportunities to gain a skill/ learn something new, improve your current understanding, or get a fresh perspective that ultimately helps you learn.Natural learning is a saga that humans experience throughout their life. Although it is not the only way of learning, it is proven more efficient than others. Therefore, practicing Natural learning will improve your methods and choices, which could result in a better you.InspirationSelf ImprovementTechnologyProduct ManagementSoftware Development----1More from Sampath MedarametlaFollowProduct Enthusiast, Project Manager and Software Engineer.Love podcasts or audiobooks?

1,10-things-i-learned-in-my-first-year-as-a-product-manager,https://www.medium.com/@salomeazeal/10-things-i-learned-in-my-first-year-as-a-product-manager-ff2ae0b07bd5?source=topics_v2---------5-84--------------------8289da90_71dd_4741_9f73_a0b0cd32bdbd-------17,"10 Things I Learned in my First Year as a Product Manager | by Salome Ogbijoko | Dec, 2022 | MediumSalome OgbijokoFollowDec 24·4 min read10 Things I Learned in my First Year as a Product ManagerPhoto by airfocus on UnsplashMy journey into product management is unconventional. I had a BSc in Information Technology, worked as an IT support in between, then started an interior design consulting business before considering a career in digital product management. While I took the Udacity Product Management Nanodegree, most of what I’ve learned has been on the job, and that’s what this article is about.1. Building cross-functional relationships Is KeyI learned that building cross-functional relationships across the entire organization is essential. I can leverage this relationship in future projects to foster inclusive participation and a collaborative mindset.2. Being too optimistic has its downsidesI learned that too much optimism could lead to the planning fallacy. I often underestimated the time required to complete specific tasks. In future projects, I will ensure agreement on a clear scope with stakeholders, consider potential risks during estimation, and add task/project buffers.3. Sliding into DM’s can be temptingIn an attempt to not expose my early work, I was used to sharing my user stories, roadmaps, and other deliverables via DM’s. I have learned to start doing my work in the project and team channels, as this has instilled confidence in me, increased my impact, and exposed my craft to the team for meaningful feedback.4. Ideation is a teamworkWorking in a team of intelligent people made me take a back seat during idea generations, even though I had first-hand insights into customer complaints. I learned that I could be participatory in developing product ideas while following optimizations set in place by the team. Once I have a list of ideas, I evaluate them and identify the most promising ones while involving my team in this process.5. Having technical knowledge can be very helpful.I learned the importance of having foundational technical knowledge by working closely with the engineering and design teams. The design team helped me gain a fair understanding of UX principles and practices, while the engineering team made me understand platform constraints and how APIs work. By collaborating with these teams, I have evolved into a product manager that can lead the creation of more effective, functional & enjoyable products that are easy to use.6. Understand the vision & future requirementsUnderstanding the vision of a product/feature, knowing the future requirements, and understanding users’ pain points and market trends helped me align my work with the overall goals and direction of the company. This helped ensure that my efforts were focused and effective and that I am contributing to the long-term success of the product.7. Building trust helps team motivationAs a product manager, I own the roadmap and decide what gets worked on, but I learned to build trust in the team to motivate them. Earning this trust involves developing a sense of maturity when assigning previous tasks. If your prioritized features never get shipped/traction, there will always be hesitation from cross-functional teams when you bring on new tasks. Team motivation always affects work output/delivery, so building that trust is necessary.8. Prioritizing “the priorities”I learned why I had to prioritize tasks by recognizing what is essential for users and my company and using a decision-making framework that guides me to make informed and strategic decisions while explaining to my teammates what should be done and why. This is a clear and structured way to explain your priorities and their reasoning.9. Curiosity is a crucial traitI learned how to be more curious, and I built the habit of doing market research on the products I work on and researching the best ways to build a feature. This might involve talking to customers, analyzing data and metrics, and staying up-to-date on industry news and trends. This act of curiosity helped me gain a deeper understanding of our users, the market, and the competitive landscape.10. Sprints help teams focus their effortsThere is a considerable temptation to favour the waterfall approach to product development in founder-led startups, but the default isn’t always valid. Waterfall involves breaking down project activities into linear sequential phases, where each stage depends on the deliverables of the previous one.I learned the why and how of scrum and conducted several sprints as necessary. This helped me to define what can be delivered within a stipulated timeline during the sprint and how much work can be achieved. A sprint is a short, time-boxed period, typically one to four weeks, during which a set of work is completed.Product ManagementProductProduct DevelopmentTeam ManagementStartup----2More from Salome OgbijokoFollowA customer centric product manager working on B2C products in the cryptocurrency space.Love podcasts or audiobooks?

But how do you know what those needs and wants are? The answer is simple: by actively seeking out and listening to customer feedback.Customer feedback is essential for product management success because it allows you to:Understand your customers’ needs and pain pointsIdentify areas for product improvementValidate product ideas and featuresIncrease customer satisfaction and loyaltyPhoto by Clay Banks on UnsplashBut how can you effectively collect and use customer feedback in your product management process? Here are some tips:Make it easy for customers to provide feedback: Provide multiple channels for customers to share their thoughts, such as through surveys, social media, or in-app feedback forms.Actively listen to and engage with customers: Show customers that their feedback is valued by responding to their comments and questions and using their feedback to inform product decisions.Analyze and prioritize feedback: Not all feedback will be equally important or relevant to your product. Use data analysis tools to identify trends and prioritize feedback based on the potential impact on your product and business.Communicate feedback to relevant teams: Share customer feedback with the relevant teams, such as engineering and design, to ensure that it is taken into consideration in product development and decision-making.Photo by AbsolutVision on UnsplashTypes of customer feedback that product managers can collectProduct managers can collect two main types of customer feedback data to inform their product development process: quantitative data and qualitative data.Quantitative data is numerical information that can be analyzed and compared, such as survey results or data from customer behavior tracking tools. This type of data is useful for understanding trends and patterns in customer feedback, and can help product managers to identify areas of strength and weakness in their products.Qualitative data, on the other hand, consists of more subjective information that cannot be easily quantified, such as open-ended comments or feedback from focus groups. This type of data can provide valuable insights into customers’ thoughts, feelings, and experiences with a product, and can help product managers to better understand the context behind their feedback.Both types of data can be useful for product managers, and it is often helpful to collect a combination of both in order to get a well-rounded understanding of customer feedback. By gathering both quantitative and qualitative data, product managers can gain a more complete picture of customer needs and preferences, and use this information to inform product development and decision-making.Photo by Gabriel Gonzalez on UnsplashHandling Negative Feedback in Product ManagementCollecting and using customer feedback can be an essential part of product management, but it is not without its challenges. One potential challenge that product managers may face is dealing with negative feedback. It can be difficult to hear that customers are unhappy with a product or feature, but it is important to remember that negative feedback can be an opportunity to learn and improve. Rather than ignoring or dismissing negative feedback, product managers should take the time to understand the root cause of the issue and consider how it can be addressed.Another potential challenge that product managers may face is managing conflicting opinions among customers. It is not uncommon for different customers to have different opinions and preferences, and it can be difficult to determine which feedback to prioritize. In these cases, it is important for product managers to consider the overall impact of different feedback on the product and the business, and to use data analysis tools to identify trends and patterns in customer feedback.Overall, it is important for product managers to remain open and receptive to customer feedback, even if it is negative or conflicting. By actively seeking out and listening to customer feedback, product managers can continually improve their products and increase customer satisfaction.In conclusion, customer feedback is a crucial aspect of product management. It helps you understand your customers, identify areas for improvement, and create products that truly meet their needs. By actively seeking out and incorporating customer feedback, you can increase customer satisfaction and drive product success.So don’t be afraid to ask for feedback and listen to what your customers have to say. Your product (and your business) will thank you for it.If you found this article helpful, don’t forget to like, comment, and share!

To date, I still make use of acronyms (self-derived lol).Luckily for me, I was able to learn and understand most Product Management acronyms. Because of my love for acronyms, I decided to write on 10 Product Management acronyms.MVP — Minimum Viable ProductMinimum viable product (MVP) refers to a product or is an early iteration of a product built to attract early-adopter customers and provide feedback quickly to help the company build out a better product.It is the version of a new product that allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least amount of effort.Examples of the company’s MVPAirbnb — started with just a blow-up mattress on the floor and 3 paying guests, who booked via a simple website but Today it’s the biggest accommodation platform in the worldTwitter — started as an internal service for the podcast platform Odeo.2. API — Application Programming InterfaceApplication Programming Interface is basically how software interacts with other software. Just like how human beings talk to each other using words, computers talk to each other using what is known as APIs.For example, let’s say I send money through mobile banking to my friend in the UK and the person receives the money, it means that my device(mobile) has “talked” with his device and told his device that I have sent her money, the amount and other details.Examples of some common APIs are Google maps, Twitter Bots, Social logins (Google, Facebook, Twitter), payment gateways etc3. AARRR Pirate MetricsA — Acquisition: describe new users of a product.A — Activation: describes the active users of your productR — Retention: describes the returning users of your productR — Referrals: these are sometimes called the evangelist i.e those users that are satisfied with your product enough to refer friends and familyR — Revenue: describes the total amount of money acquired4. HEART frameworkH — Happiness: describes how users feel about your product or feature.E — Engagement: describes user involvement with your productA — Adoption: measures how often, and quickly users adapt to the productR — Retention: describes the rate at which users are returning to your product.T — Task Success: describes how successful it is for users to achieve their goals.5. MoSCoW — is a prioritization methodM- Must have: features that are vital to the product. Without these features, the product is incomplete i.e they are non-negotiable features. Must have features are called the minimum requirementsS- Should have: features that are important, not absolutely mandatory but add significant value to the product. Sometimes without these features, the product can work. The features are highly prioritized for future releasesM- Must have: features that are nice to have but not essential. Add little to no value if left out. Are highly deprioritized before Should have featuresW- Won’t have/will not have: features that are not needed. These features are the least prioritized. You can use this as a feature idea backlog6. SWOTIs a framework used to assess and understand the internal and external forces that may create opportunities or risks for the companyS- Strength: company’s competitive advantage over other companies i.e unique value prepositionW- Weakness: where the company is lacking, at disadvantaged compared to its competitorsO- Opportunities: external factors that represent possible improvements for the companyT- Threats: these are external forces that represent risks to the companyNB: Strength and Weaknesses are internal factors while Opportunities are Threats are external factors7. USP — Unique Selling PrepositionA unique selling preposition (USP) is the competitive advantage a company have over the other company. It is what sets your product apart from others and tells customers why they should choose you. It can be ease of use, price, customer experience etc. It could be anything. A strong unique selling proposition can help you attract and retain customers and reduce churn.8. CAC — Customer Acquisition CostCustomer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is how much it cost a company to attract new customers. CAC measures all the costs spent on acquiring or attracting new customers. Cost can be marketing expenses, sales expenses, advertising etc9. GTM — Go-To-MarketGo-To-Market is a strategic plan that a company develop on how to successfully launch a product or feature to the market. GTM strategy includes a customer journey map, a marketing plan, and a concrete sales and distribution strategy. The GTM strategy framework varies by company, but it generally includes a business plan detailing the target audience, a marketing plan, and a sales strategy.10. KPI — Key Performance IndicatorKey Performance Indicators are quantitative metrics companies use to track and analyze performance or progress toward a business objective. In order words, KPIs are the primary metrics used to monitor the performance of your product. Some examples of KPIs include Customer acquisition cost, net promoter scores, churn, monthly recurring revenue, customer lifetime value etc.In SummaryAs a Product Manager, it is very important to know most of all these Acronyms because most times you communicate with yourselves using acronyms.

You know how crucial a product roadmap is for planning out the development and launch of new products or features. But with so many stakeholders and moving parts to consider, it can be a challenge to effectively manage your product roadmap. That’s where these 5 tips come in.In this article, I’ll share practical, actionable advice for successfully managing your product roadmap and bringing your vision to life. Whether you’re a seasoned pro or just starting out in product management, these tips will help you stay on track and achieve your goals. So, without further ado, let’s dive in!Photo by Jo Szczepanska on UnsplashTip #1: Clearly Define Your Objectives and PrioritiesBefore you start building out your product roadmap, it’s important to clearly define your objectives and priorities. What are your long-term goals for the product? Who is your target audience? What are the most important features or functionality to include? Answering these questions will help you focus on the most critical elements of your roadmap and ensure that you’re working towards your desired outcomes.Tip #2: Involve Your StakeholdersYour product roadmap should not be developed in a vacuum. It’s important to involve your stakeholders in the planning process so that everyone is on the same page and can provide valuable input. This includes your team members, executives, customers, and any other relevant parties.But how do you effectively involve all of these stakeholders in the process? One effective technique is to hold regular meetings or workshops where everyone can collaborate and contribute their ideas and feedback. By getting input from a diverse group of stakeholders, you’ll be able to build a roadmap that reflects the needs and desires of everyone involved.Photo by Redd F on UnsplashTip #3: Be Flexible and AdaptableNo matter how well you plan, things will inevitably change. Your product roadmap should be flexible and adaptable to accommodate these changes. This means that you should be willing to pivot or adjust your priorities if new information or opportunities arise. But how do you balance the need for flexibility with the need for focus and direction? One approach is to build in regular review periods where you can assess the progress of your roadmap and make any necessary adjustments.Remember, the goal of a product roadmap is to guide your product development, not to dictate it. Be open to new ideas and be ready to adjust your course as needed.Photo by Brands&People on UnsplashTip #4: Communicate RegularlyEffective communication is key to successfully managing your product roadmap. It’s important to keep your team, stakeholders, and customers informed about your plans and progress. This includes regular updates on what’s been accomplished, what’s coming up next, and any changes to the roadmap. But how do you ensure that your communication is effective and reaches the right people?Establish clear communication channels and protocols, such as regular meetings, email updates, or project management software. By keeping everyone in the loop, you’ll be able to stay aligned and avoid any potential roadblocks or misunderstandings.Photo by airfocus on UnsplashTip #5: Use the Right Tools and TechniquesThere are many different tools and techniques you can use to manage your product roadmap. From project management software to visual planning tools, the options are endless.The key is to find the tools and techniques that work best for your team and your product. But how do you determine the right tools and techniques for your needs? Try out a few different options and see what works best. Experiment with different approaches and don’t be afraid to try something new if it has the potential to improve your roadmap management process.Successfully managing a product roadmap requires clear objectives and priorities, stakeholder involvement, flexibility and adaptability, regular communication, and the use of the right tools and techniques. By following these 5 tips, you can effectively guide the development and launch of your product and bring your vision to life.Don’t let the complexity of managing a product roadmap hold you back — with the right approach, you can achieve great things.If you found these tips helpful, please consider sharing this article with your colleagues and friends, and don’t forget to leave a comment below to let us know your thoughts.Product ManagementSoftware DevelopmentBusinessManagementProductivity----More from Togay AytemizFollowExperienced product manager with a track record of success.

No one expects them to.In today’s world of information overload we tend to believe we should know it all, to be an expert. This isn’t the case. It’s reported that it takes an average of 10,000 hours in order to master anything [from Malcolm Gladwell’s blockbuster book, “Outliers.”]. That’s more than a year (every second in it) to master anything. Same applies to product management. You need to move from one level to another.It’s not expected of you to know everything when you’re just starting out/junior. Everyone grows and keeps growing, and I must say, that’s always true for everything in life.I have been in the space for more than ten years now and would like to share a thing or two that I have seen over the years work when mentoring/guiding anyone trying to transition into product management. These are basically recommendations as to resources you can utilize to gain the required knowledge and skills while starting out a career in product management.First, I recommend that you develop your critical thinking skills. As you will learn over time, product managers are always in situations where they will either be solving problems or influencing others who can solve problems. Problem solving is a vital skill and understanding the basics will help goa long way.You can take any of these two free courses;1. Agile Innovation and Problem Solving Skills | edX2. Problem Solving and Critical Thinking Skills | AlisonAs a greatproblem solver, you need to be able to analyze critically at all times. Thinking things through and being open to feedback (constructive & RAW) and criticism is something you need to be aware of inthis journey.My first book recommendation is, The Product Book: How to Become a Great Product Manager.This book does justice as a soft landing on product management and it’s the first book that I would recommend. Taking time to digest its content will do you good. It’s available for FREE(Link The Product Book: How to Become a Great Product Manager — Product School).For everyone who reached out to me in the year 2022 and maybe beyond I always recommend this introductory course on Product Management from The University of MarylandProduct Management Fundamentals | edX. It builds on previous recommendations and gives another perspective.My second book recommendation is Cracking the PM Interview: How to Land a Product Manager Job in Technology. A toolbox is the bestway to describe this book. In particular, it concentrates on understanding what product management is, preparing for interviews, a career in product management, writing resumes, and more.Please feel free to share your thoughts, comments, suggestions and feedback in the comments section.Gracias!Product ManagementGetting StartedProduct ManagerProduct Management Career----More from Abisoye FalabiFollowAutodidact // Author @pluralsight // Usergroup Organizer @dotnetlagos // Director (Product & Technology & Processes) //Love podcasts or audiobooks?

Image by Oscar Orozco.Creating in The Era of Creative ConfidenceIt’s remarkable to watch a five-year-old draw, void of any anxiety about what the world will think. We all start our lives creatively confident, happy to create and share our work with pride. And then, as we age, our comfort with creative expression declines. We’re discouraged by the learning curve of creative skills and tools, by our tendency to compare ourselves to others, and by the harsh opinions of critics. As Picasso famously quipped, “All children are born artists, the problem is to remain an artist as we grow up.” It is a sad irony: As we age, our creative capabilities (and opportunities!) grow as we collect life experiences that inspire us — but our creative confidence shrinks. We are more creatively confident in kindergarten than we are as adults. Correcting this is among the greatest opportunities for the next generation of humankind.Well, we’re entering an era that changes everything. A few critical technology breakthroughs and fundamentally more accessible platforms are changing everything. From free web-based tools with templates that help conquer the fear of the blank screen to powerful generative artificial intelligence that conjures up anything from a text prompt, expressing yourself creatively no longer requires climbing creativity’s notoriously steep learning curve.As these new tools give millions (or billions!) more people life-long creative confidence, what are the implications for society at large? How is this good for humanity, and what does it mean for the professional creators among us? I see seismic shifts ahead. How creators get compensated will change. How people succeed and get promoted in most jobs will change. And the nature and goals of K-12 education will change. Humanity will gradually shift from the insatiable pursuit of productivity to individual differentiation through creativity. Culture itself will evolve as creative expression is democratized, empowering all of us to personalize fashion and our everyday life experiences in miraculous ways.So, let’s better understand the drivers here:• The Death of Creativity’s Learning Curve• The Opportunity for Creative Pros in the Era of Creative Confidence• Implications for Creative Careers, Culture, & BeyondThe Death of Creativity’s Learning CurveWelcome to an era in which the friction between an idea, and creatively expressing that idea, is removed. Whether it is as an image, an essay, an animated story, or even a video, you can simply talk about what you see in your mind’s eye and get immediate visual output. “But that’s not real creativity!” some may exclaim. Until now, “creativity” has conflated both the generation of ideas and the process involved to express those ideas. Is the process of intricately chiseling a beautiful sculpture creative, or is the idea of the sculpture — the image conjured up in the mind’s eye — the truly creative part of an otherwise laborious and tedious process? It’s an age-old argument. Michelangelo, for instance, believed that each stone has a statue inside it and the sculptor discovers it by chipping away. At the same time, the great master employed as many as 13 assistants to help him paint the Sistine Chapel. So, it’s complicated.Most artists today can’t afford 13 human assistants, but they use other tools to reduce the laborious parts of creativity, including AI-powered shortcuts, component libraries for product designers, templates, and now generative AI. This latest breakthrough has elicited both fanfare and fear because of its ability to conjure up an original piece of media based solely on a text prompt. Conceptually, it’s like a roomful of inexperienced interns who instantly present you with endless renditions of whatever you describe. Most of what they present will be wrong, but you may get some stuff to work with and, occasionally, something novel will catch your eye.Of course, behind the scenes, the machine learning engines that drive AI creation were trained using millions of pieces of content from real artists, many of whom never consented to having their work used in that way. To correct this, I anticipate a series of regulations, evolutions in copyright law, new walled gardens and token-gated portfolio experiences, and new compensation models for artists that opt-in and/or allow use of their style for GenerativeAI purposes. Serious issues to solve and unfortunately, as usual, the availability of such tech preceded these discussions. But here we are, and we need to both find the path to sustainability as well as the opportunities for both artists and non-artists alike.The Opportunity for Creative Pros in the Era of Creative ConfidenceAs someone driven to help all people access the tools for creative expression, it has been thrilling to watch hundreds of millions of people who may have been intimidated by professional-grade tools like Photoshop or Premiere Pro begin tinkering creatively using new template-based and AI-driven tools and technologies. At the same time, there is a common sentiment — and often times anxiety — among creative professionals that these tools threaten their livelihoods.Humans have always been frenemies with new technology. We relish the efficiencies and welcome having more brain power for higher order tasks. And yet we fret the interim disruptions as we adjust. That was the case with the advent of photography, automobiles, and desktop publishing, and I don’t think this is an exception. As more human jobs become assisted, automated, or replaced by artificial intelligence, we must spend our hours where we have a competitive advantage over machines: developing new ideas, expressing old things in new ways, innovating process, and crafting the story that infuses our creations with meaning.As generative AI gets better at producing content, it’s important to remember that creativity is about far more than the outcome. The striking and wondrous thing about creativity is its mysterious seeds of origin. Do net new ideas come from genuine curiosity and initiative? Mistakes of the eye? Childhood traumas? Nobody fully understands the origins of ingenuity, but we know it is a function of the arrangement of our neurons and is as individualistic as our fingerprints. The creations that see the light of day in the form of pigment or pixels or breakthrough businesses are the result of these mysterious inner workings. Creativity is not just the output, it is the inputs — the ideas and the ingenuity. It’s the judgment to know when something is good and when it’s done. It is the creative control to modify and iterate based on a career of fine-tuned intuition. It is the unique human story that brought it to life, and the story we share that gives the work meaning to those who experience it. And it is the innovation in the creative process itself that distinguishes the outcome. As the process part of creativity — chipping away at the stone or mixing the colors or iterating the pixels — becomes less of an obstacle, the other parts of creativity — the original idea, the judgment, the innovations in process, and the story — become more important than ever.Herein lies the opportunity for the creative professionals among us. While the world becomes more creatively confident and empowered, there will always be an opportunity to go further. The magic of creativity — the many inputs of life experience, emotion, and how they influence our approach to our work — remain in our creative control. And we know, creativity is most impactful when accompanied by meaning and story. AI models and templates can’t generate meaning.Implications for Creative Careers, Culture, & BeyondCompensation will change. We all know that an insight from a creative genius may happen in an instant, but is often the product of decades of experience, trial-and-error, and lessons learned. Do creative people get paid for their judgment and ideas, or their time? Historically, time has been the easiest measure of work and the most popular factor for charging for work completed. But, in an era in which much of our mundane and repetitive work is accomplished by AI-powered assistants, the time required for creative work has materially reduced. So, how do creators — and other disciplines where judgment and taste are the result of a lifetime’s work — start charging for value added, as opposed to time spent? Perhaps there is, someday, some mutually agreed upon pricing model that takes experience into account? Perhaps more creative teams will get compensated based on the performance of their work? Compensation is ripe for re-imagination in the era of AI.The “story” behind the work becomes more important and front and center. As any art collector knows, the fine art world is as much (nah, more!) about the story than it is about the paint on a canvas. Within a gallery, a piece is valued based on its lineage, its originality, and the trials and tribulations of the artist. A replica of a priceless work is worth nothing. “This was created by Generative AI model X based on Y text prompt” is a pretty lackluster and uninspiring story, much like “This was painted by X as a replica of a masterpiece painted by Y.” Who cares? So, if the story defines the value and respect for a work of fine art, why wouldn’t the premium of story carry over to other creative genres, especially in a world where anyone can generate anything with a text prompt (or print a replica with a printer)?Creativity is the human creator just as much as the outcome. Will future brand campaigns spotlight the inspirations and creative teams behind them? Will we purchase digital art that is cryptographically signed by humans rather than AI models? (Adobe’s founding role in the Content Authenticity Initiative is partly inspired by this conviction). Take a stroll through TikTok’s greatest hits and you’ll see that people are clearly more engaged by a creator’s process than the outcome. With due respect to TikTok creators, their success isn’t purely because of the technical skill of their dancing, singing, or acting. It’s the spirit and humor they bring to whatever they do. If the human behind the art is what distinguishes and captivates, then generative AI will only further spotlight the value of creators and their stories.As people gain creative confidence and access to expressive tools, culture will change as fashion and life design (your furniture, wallpaper, etc.) becomes hyper-personalized. Today, the designs in your life are created by small teams and generalized for the masses. The clothes you wear, the media you consume, the digital dashboard in your car, the items in your home — they are all made by a few and generalized for as many as possible. But with widespread creative confidence will come a desire to culturally flex yourself through personalization. Tools like Adobe Express, Lightroom, and Canva are already enabling people and small businesses to personalize their marketing, greeting cards, and photos at a professional grade without the learning curve. But I anticipate a world in which you customize your shoes or clothing before checking out (or select an artist to do it and ship your purchase to them first!). I anticipate that our experiences in cars will be personalized by us using templates for the dashboard design and customization kits for interiors. And when we start wearing AR glasses around, every person’s world will look remarkably different, by design, just because we can!The “Sneaker Maker” customization station, where an artist-in-residence makes your sneakers yours at the Golden Goose store in Aspen, Colorado. The future of retail? Photo by Scott BelskyWe will stand out in school and at work with our creativity rather than our productivity. Success in most white-collar jobs — and hopefully K-12 education — will shift from the endless drive for more productivity — being promoted because you accomplished more in less time — to standing out through your creativity. As much of work becomes automated and AI-assisted, our ingenuity in merchandising ideas, our use of data to make compelling arguments, and our empathy-driven insights to solve customer problems should be what makes us successful. I like to say creativity is the new productivity because creative skills are what will distinguish humans most in the years to come.Welcoming & Adapting to Ubiquitous Creative ConfidenceAs the expression of ideas becomes exponentially easier, the ideas themselves become more of the differentiator (yes, I think “Prompt Engineering” will become a discipline in and of itself!). Good ideas aren’t derived solely from logic and patterns of the past; they’re also the product of human traumas, mistakes of the eye, and uniquely human ingenuity. I am excited about AI, but I am ultimately long on creativity (aka humanity). With fundamentally easier execution of ideas and more ideas actually seeing the light of day, perhaps meritocracy will kick in and help the best ideas — now sourced from a far greater pool of creators — get the best opportunity and reach the most people.Much like every sport’s top athletes improve every generation, so should creatives. I would argue that AI is like some breakthrough new racket or sneaker — it almost unfairly elevates the game for every player and allows the very best to advance the game itself. Revolutionary tennis rackets and string technology allowed any weekend player to hit shots they never would have been capable of before. But it didn’t turn them into Rafa Nadal or Roger Federer. People with extraordinary talent, dedication, and fortitude will always stand out.So here’s my plea to the creative community: As new technology and the “creativity for all” revolution ushers in the era of creative confidence, let’s welcome all the new players. But, in parallel, lets elevate our own game and advance every creative field through our own ingenuity. Let’s embrace yet pressure-test the new tech on our own terms — insisting on attribution, getting compensated for our work, and leaning into new models founded on ethics and dedicated to instilling creative confidence.TechnologyDesignBusinessEntrepreneurshipProduct Management----4More from Scott BelskyFollowfounder @Behance, cpo @Adobe, early stage investor and product obsessive; author of Making Ideas Happen and The Messy Middle. http://scottbelsky.comLove podcasts or audiobooks?

With limited time and resources, it’s crucial to make informed decisions about what to focus on and when.Enter prioritization frameworks. These tried-and-true methods can help us break down our work into more manageable pieces and make informed decisions about what to prioritize. Here are five proven frameworks to boost your productivity as a product manager:The Priority MatrixLooking to boost your productivity and make smarter prioritization decisions? Look no further than the Priority Matrix! This powerful tool breaks down tasks and projects into four quadrants based on their importance and urgency, helping you focus on the most important tasks first and allocate your time and resources wisely.But what exactly is the Priority Matrix and how does it work? Simply put, it’s a visual way to prioritize tasks based on two key factors: their importance and their urgency. Tasks that are both important and urgent go in the top left quadrant, while tasks that are important but not urgent go in the top right. Tasks that are neither important nor urgent go in the bottom right, and tasks that are urgent but not important go in the bottom left.One of the pros of using the Priority Matrix is its simplicity and flexibility. It’s a tool that anyone can use, and it’s easy to modify as priorities change. Plus, it helps prevent multitasking and the associated productivity drain.However, it’s important to note that the Priority Matrix is not a catch-all solution. It’s subjective and may not take into account all of the relevant factors that go into prioritization. To truly make informed decisions, it’s important to use additional data and insights. Additionally, the matrix can only be used to prioritize tasks and projects, not ideas or goals.So, are you ready to boost your productivity and make smarter prioritization decisions with the Priority Matrix? Start using it today and watch your productivity soar!The Kano ModelLooking to prioritize and improve your product or service offerings? Look no further than the Kano Model! This innovative framework helps product managers understand customer needs and preferences, so they can identify which features and attributes will have the biggest impact on customer satisfaction.But what exactly is the Kano Model and how does it work? Simply put, it’s a way to categorize product features based on their impact on customer satisfaction. There are three main categories: Must-have, Performance, and Delight. Must-have features are those that customers expect and will be dissatisfied if they’re not present. Performance features are those that contribute to an overall positive experience, but are not necessarily expected. Delight features are those that exceed customer expectations and create a wow factor.One of the pros of using the Kano Model is that it helps product managers understand what features are truly important to customers, rather than just guessing or relying on assumptions. It also helps prioritize development efforts and allocate resources effectively.There are a few potential drawbacks to using the Kano Model as a framework for prioritization. One potential drawback is that the model relies on subjective judgments about which features fall into which category (basic, performance, or delight). This subjectivity can introduce bias and make it difficult to consistently apply the model across different products or teams.Another potential drawback of the Kano Model is that it requires extensive customer research to fully understand which features fall into which category. This can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially if the product or service has a large number of features. Additionally, the model assumes that all customers have the same needs and expectations, which may not always be the case.The Kano Model does not consider other factors that may be important for prioritization, such as the complexity or cost of implementing a feature, or the potential impact on other areas of the business. As a result, product managers may need to supplement the model with other tools or techniques to fully evaluate the potential benefits and drawbacks of different features.The MoSCoW MethodThe MoSCoW method is a prioritization framework that helps product managers and teams prioritize their work by dividing it into four categories: Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won’t have.Benefits of using the MoSCoW method include:Clearly defining priorities and helping teams understand what is most importantAllowing teams to focus on high-impact work that delivers the most value to customers and stakeholdersFacilitating better communication and alignment within teams and with stakeholdersPositive sides of using the MoSCoW method include:Its simplicity and ease of useIts flexibility, as it can be easily adapted to different types of projects and teamsIts ability to help teams identify and prioritize work that is most critical to meeting business goalsDrawbacks of using the MoSCoW method include:Its reliance on subjective judgment, as team members may have different perspectives on what should be considered a “must have” or “should have”Its potential to create confusion or conflict within teams if priorities are not clearly defined or communicatedIts inability to take into account other factors that may influence prioritization, such as resources, time constraints, and dependencies.Overall, the MoSCoW method can be a useful tool for helping product managers and teams prioritize their work, as long as it is used in conjunction with other methods and considerations and is regularly reviewed and updated.The RICE MethodThe RICE method is a prioritization framework that helps product managers prioritize their work and make informed decisions about what to focus on. It stands for Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort. By evaluating each project or task based on these four criteria, product managers can more effectively prioritize their work.RICE method takes into account both the potential impact of a project and the level of effort required to complete it. This allows product managers to prioritize projects that will have the greatest impact in relation to the resources required.One of the positive sides of using the RICE method is that it is easy to understand and implement. It also helps product managers to clearly communicate their prioritization decisions to stakeholders. However, one potential drawback is that it may not take into account all of the factors that should be considered when prioritizing work. It is important to use the RICE method as just one tool in a comprehensive prioritization process.One potential drawback of using the RICE method for prioritization is that it may not take into account the complexity or difficulty of the work being prioritized. For example, a project that has a high impact and high confidence of success but is also relatively simple to implement may be given the same priority as a project with a high impact and high confidence of success but is more complex and requires more resources to complete. This can lead to an imbalance in the workload of the team and potentially cause delays or challenges in completing the more complex projects.Additionally, the RICE method may not consider the interdependencies between projects or the impact that prioritizing one project may have on the progress of others.The Eisenhower MatrixThe Eisenhower Matrix, also known as the Urgent/Important Matrix, is a tool that helps you prioritize tasks by separating them into four quadrants:Important and Urgent: Tasks that need to be done immediately, as they have a high impact and are time-sensitive.Important, but Not Urgent: Tasks that are important, but do not need to be done immediately. These should be scheduled for the future.Urgent, but Not Important: Tasks that are time-sensitive, but do not have a high impact. These can be delegated to others or postponed until a later date.Not Important and Not Urgent: Tasks that are neither important nor urgent. These can be eliminated or outsourced.Using the Eisenhower Matrix can help you focus on the tasks that truly matter, while also helping you manage your time more effectively. One of the main benefits of this method is that it helps you avoid the trap of focusing on low-impact tasks that are urgent, but not important.One potential drawback of the Eisenhower Matrix is that it can be difficult to accurately determine which tasks fall into which quadrant. It may also be challenging to determine the true importance and urgency of certain tasks, especially if you are not familiar with the work.Which one should I Use?By using one (or a combination) of these prioritization frameworks, you can make more informed decisions about what to focus on as a product manager. And don’t forget to regularly reevaluate your priorities to ensure you are still aligning with business goals and meeting the needs of your customers.In conclusion, prioritization frameworks can be a valuable tool for product managers looking to boost their productivity and make informed decisions about what to focus on. Whether you choose the Priority Matrix, the Kano Model, the MoSCoW Method, the RICE Method, or the Eisenhower Matrix, these frameworks can help you break down your work and prioritize effectively.So give one (or more) a try and see the impact it can have on your productivity as a product manager.

On the Meta level, a product manager connects business strategy, design knowledge, and customer needs in order to develop a product that is relevant, feasible, and valuable. PM is a person who understands the customer better than anybody in an organization, knows what vision CEO/Business has, and becomes the best problem solver to tackle customers’ needs.The main responsibilities of a Product Manager often include:Market & Competitive Research: This I would say take up 25% of the PM role.Customer Research: This is the most important task of PM for a early stage startupPrioritization and Road-mapping: Understanding which problem to solve first.Product Design: Bringing ideas into visual context.Development: Get the Design into Action.Performance Measurement & Analysis: Track the progress of your actionIn my past 5 years of experience in PM role, I have invested most of my time in the above segments. As I majorly worked in early-stage startups, market and customer research takes up almost 40% percent of my time. This I would say is the most critical aspect if you are in the early stage of your journey.In this article, I wanted to share some of the very important tools that I used as a PM. Knowing these tools has made my life easy and helped me become a better product manager. If there are any useful tools I missed out on, I would also appreciate it if you could comment so that everyone can learn from them as well.Market & Competitive ResearchObjective: To understand the current market and your market competitors. Tools/Resources:Google Trends: Learn what people search forSemrush (spyfu, similarweb are also a good alternative): Under traffic of your competitorBuildwith: know the competitor tech stackScreen Recording tool (Tella.tv): Record your competitor’s product and do a product teardown.Become a customer of your competitor: Use your competitor’s product as if you are a QA of it.Customer/UX AnalysisObjective: To understand your customer (their pain points) and their user behavior. This is the most important step if you are in the early stage of product development.Tools/Resources:Hotjar: Understand how users interact with your productGoogle Analytics: Knowing every bit of information, where users are visiting most, where is the highest drop etc.IVR - Callhippo, Exotel, Ameyo: This is very important to do cold calling and then understand your call detail analysis it.User Engagement: Mixpanel, MoEngage, Clevertap — These tools are required to do user journey mapping.Prioritization & Road-MappingObjective: This is majorly an internal activity to become more clear on what task to take up and when. It also helps me to be fully transparent about your upcoming projects and their respective timelines to your higher management.Tools/Resources:Miro: This is one of the best whiteboard toolsWhimsical, Balsamiq: Best for making wireframesClickup: I will recommend this above Jira, Asana or Trello. It is one app that replaces them all.Notion: It has many applications, but I use it majorly for note-writing, planning, content.Jira, Confluence: I use it majorly for PRD and issue tracking. We then moved from Jira to ClickUp.Product DesignObjective: I have to work on wireframes and designs myself before presenting them to the product designer. This also helps me plan out all use cases, exception handling, and acceptance criteria.Tools/Resources:FigmaMiroSketchWhimsical, BalsamiqCanvaDevelopmentObjective: While as a PM, I don’t get into coding myself, giving the right direction on how to get it implemented makes a lot of difference. From selecting if we can get the MVP released superfast, to using low-code/no-code platforms. Here are some of the tools I would recommend one should know.Tools/Resources:Frappe Framework-ERPNext: This by far I would say the most important to set up any organization’s backend structure. I wrote a whole post on this.Webflow: Designing stunning landing pages all on your own.Appsmith / Retool: Fastest way to build internal tools.Bubble: I am learning this, it gives me a lot of ideas on the complete development journey.

Those findings that prove to be valuable over multiple years are the special highlights of a researcher’s career 🌟This brings me to a successful study that I and my colleagues conducted a couple of years ago and that is still having an impact on the company. This study had a unique methodology that I don’t often see mentioned in UX circles.If there is one thing I want you to take from this post, it’s that interviews and surveys are not the only methods that can help you to uncover customer pains and desires. What if I told you that there is a cheap way to do qualitative research with quantifiable outcomes? Want to know more? Continue reading.Interviews and surveys are not the only methods that can help you to uncover customer pains and desires.Project backgroundIt all got started when I and my colleagues were very eager to learn about the pains and needs of a specific customer segment of our company’s software product. As it’s a difficult segment to reach and the time was limited, we decided to look further from traditional UX research methods. Instead of conducting interviews, we decided to leverage the call recordings of customer-facing teams.We listened through the recordings of recent sales and customer success calls and took notes about the important topics and struggles that this segment mentioned. Another option would have been to join the calls live, but we didn’t want to disturb the workflow of customer-facing teams. It’s also more difficult to take notes on the go.Project processFor starters, we listened through just a few calls to get an understanding of the topics that get covered during these meetings. This helped us to understand the main themes and keywords that we would later use to code our notes.As a next step, we listened through bigger sets of recordings and wrote down all insightful quotes into a spreadsheet, and labeled each quote with a keyword. This gave us an overview of which topics get mentioned and how many times.The initial plan was to listen to just 30 calls, but as we understood the value of the insights, we decided to continue with the study throughout three quarters. During this time we listened to 160+ customer calls and reached the point where we could prioritize customer pain points with a help of numbers. With the timeframe we had, we wouldn’t have been able to conduct 160+ interviews, and honestly, it wouldn’t have been worth the effort. With the recordings, on the other hand, it didn’t take as much time.But now to the most important part, the learnings💡 This method definitely had benefits and overall it was refreshing to learn from customers in a different way. But I will also share what you need to think through before jumping into a similar study.Advantages of using customer-facing calls as a data sourceUnbiased insight into customer painsTo my surprise, I discovered that customers are more open and honest in customer success calls than in user interviews. Perhaps they feel that this is the place where they can freely vent about topics that really matter to them. There is no researcher with an interview script, focusing on a specific topic. Also, they are familiar with their dedicated account manager and have built a rapport with him/her during previous calls. As a researcher, it’s difficult to get to the same level of closeness with just a 30-minute interview. In addition, as a researcher, customers often perceive you as part of the design and product team and thus, ready to please you, might not share their honest opinion about the product and the feature ideas you have.To my surprise, I discovered that customers are more open and honest in customer success calls than in user interviews. Perhaps they feel that this is the place where they can freely vent about topics that really matter to them.It’s relatively quickExisting call recordings can be a lifesaver if you are in a hurry and don’t want to spend time recruiting and interviewing. You can just dive into the data and start grasping the patterns. It also helps you save money on incentives and recruitment panels.It can be a big help if you are a product manager or designer without a research department in the company. If you don’t have time to conduct interviews, call recordings can help you out. You can even create a routine out of it and listen to 1–2 calls per week to stay close to your customers.Learn about people you don’t meet in interviewsAnother reason why I love to research based on the recordings is that it gives me a chance to learn from people who I don’t meet in interviews. There are certain types of customers who always want to jump on the research calls, they are often either your biggest fans or most active critics. This way, it’s difficult to get input from an “average user”.Also, I found it difficult to get in touch with people who are in the buying phase of the product. Recordings of the sales calls helped out here and gave plenty of insights into customers’ buying requirements.Recordings of the sales calls gave plenty of insights into customers’ buying requirements.You get quality but also quantityIn its essence, using data from customer-facing calls is a qualitative research method, meaning it gives you in-depth insight into your customer’s workflows, problems, and goals. But if you are lucky and there are a lot of call recordings available, you can listen through so many of them that the findings become quantifiable. This is best achieved by using a spreadsheet. Just write down every time someone mentioned a specific topic or a keyword. That way you can in the end count which topics were mentioned the most.What to keep in mindDon’t ditch interviewing completelyIt is obvious but still worth mentioning that sometimes a classic user interview works better. As in our case, we wanted to know the main problems of this segment overall, the method worked fine. But if you want to know specific details about a certain topic, then stick with interviews, as digging for details from recordings might take a while.My biggest issue with relying on the recordings, compared to interviews, was that I couldn’t ask additional “why’s”. I saw so many opportunities to dig deeper into the true nature of customer problems but was not able to do so because of the nature of the method.You need to get internal buy-inAs everything in life starts with relationships, in order to be able to use the recordings, you need to first get along with your customer-facing teams. It might take some time to get permission and access to this type of sensitive data. You need to explain well why you want to listen to the recordings and how you will use the outcomes. Emphasize that you are not assessing the job skills of the sales and success team, and are purely focusing on customer issues. Don’t criticize how somebody handles the calls, this is not your task.🤓 Pro-tip. Even if you are not using the recordings for research, stay close to the customer-facing teams anyway. These people have gathered vast knowledge about customers and you can leverage that. For example, it’s a good idea to validate your research findings with these folks or even have a recurring catch-up with them.Inform customers that you listen to their callsWhen doing any type of user research, it’s always crucial to consider data privacy rules. Ask your customer-facing teams to inform call participants that the call is recorded not only for quality assurance purposes but also for research. And as always, when storing the data, keep in mind data security rules and be compliant with applicable regulations.In conclusionI think the reason why this study is still going strong, is that in addition to the rich and honest insights, it also gave us statistical confidence. Thanks to the large amount of data available, we were able to quantify the findings. The unique approach brought us to valuable conclusions which impacted the long-term product strategy and continue to do so.It ended up being a successful experiment and I recommend trying it out whenever classical UX research methods are not an option. Resources are always limited, so consider recycling existing data and knowledge whenever possible.Please share in the comments if you discover any other under-radar sources of customer insights 🙏Thank you to Maria Saviste and Hard Perk for contributing to the study.

However, beyond just branding, there have been significant advances in the practical application of AI techniques in sales workflows. This article aims to document and explore these developments.Rule-based “AI”At the beginning of the previous decade, the first mentions of “AI-driven” feature emerged in areas such as task management and identifying potential “hot” leads for sales reps. However, these features were primarily based on predetermined rules.For example, to determine a hot lead, a product assigned different values to factors such as the source of the lead, the number of email responses, the age of the lead, and the location, and then compared the total scores to identify the most promising leads.Similarly, task prioritization was based on rules, such as giving higher priority to sending the first cold email to a hot lead over sending a follow-up email to a lead who is not responding.This was a time when there was insufficient sales data to build accurate predictive models, and both users and product teams were unsure about the usefulness of machine learning in this field.Sentiment Analysis/Speech-to-text/Automated SummarizationTechnologies such as natural language processing, speech-to-text, and OCR (optical character recognition), which are based on AI techniques, were some of the first practical applications of AI in various sales workflows.You could allow a bot to access your inbox and automatically read the emails to determine the sentiment of the prospect and create follow-up tasks for you if there is a task mentioned in the email.A mobile app could use OCR to scan business cards and automatically create or update contacts/leads in your CRM.Automatic summarization allowed sales apps to go through tons of news articles and highlight the relevant bits to sales folks.One of the major challenges for sales apps was getting sales development representatives (SDRs) or account executives (AEs) to consistently update detailed notes, particularly after customer meetings. This had a ripple effect on pipeline forecasting, as the updates are crucial in determining whether a meeting will be scheduled or if an opportunity is progressing well. The use of speech-to-text technology, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR) in AI, helped significantly in addressing this issue, as users could simply tap a button to record meeting notes in their voice, which were then automatically transcribed into text, recorded as an activity in the customer relationship management (CRM) system, and used to create follow-up tasks for the sales team.These solutions gained traction because they did not require a large amount of sales data to build upon and were easy to adopt, as users quickly saw the efficiency improvements they provided in their workflows.Predictive modelingPredictive modeling was then used to forecast the outcomes of sales workflows, such as the probability of an opportunity closing and the expected close quarter and numbers. Activities and opportunity data points were used to build these predictions.However, many of these features did not see widespread adoption among salespeople, partly due to the nature of their work. In particular, long-cycle B2B sales, which involve a high degree of unpredictability and multiple decision-makers, were challenging to predict accurately. Additionally, experienced salespeople did not want to be told whether their opportunities are likely to close or not.This demonstrated that the successful implementation of AI can only occur in ways that enhance efficiency and productivity, rather than in situations where human oversight and decision-making are required.Predictive modeling found its application in other areas though such as segmenting customers based on factors such as demographics, purchase history, and behavior. This helped sales teams tailor their approaches and create targeted marketing campaigns that are more likely to be successful. Chatbots built using predictive analytics proved helpful in generating qualified leads and reducing churn apart from scheduling appointments.GPT-3GPT-3 has the potential to revolutionize the way cold outreach emails are created by allowing for the automation of highly personalized emails. The language generated by GPT-3 is so sophisticated that it is difficult to tell if the emails were not written by a human. All you need to do is provide the model with data from social media and your product’s value proposition, and it can generate a personalized email in just a few seconds.This also has the potential to automate the job of sales development representatives (SDRs), who typically reach out to prospects through cold emails to try to schedule appointments. It is likely that this technology will eventually lead to the elimination of SDR roles as we currently know them, as the system will be able to identify the most promising prospects and determine the most appropriate context for outreach while the workflow is already automated .In the future, it is likely that the increasing use of AI in the sales workflow will result in changes to the nature of work for sales staff. They may need to acquire more skills in using AI tools or shift their focus to tasks that require human judgment and decision-making, such as strategic planning and relationship-building. The impact on employment will depend on how the technology is implemented and how well workers adapt to these changes.I hope you found this article helpful and would love to know your thoughts on it.

Product engagement and stickiness are… | by Soroush Alavi | Dec, 2022 | MediumSoroush AlaviFollowDec 23·11 min readFrom Engagement to StickinessCrafted with DALL·EProduct engagement and stickiness are two key metrics that can have a significant impact on the success of a product or business.Engagement refers to the level of interaction and activity that users have with a product or service. A product that is engaging is able to hold the attention and interest of its users, encouraging them to spend more time with it and use it more frequently. High levels of product engagement can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty, as well as greater potential for monetization.Stickiness refers to the ability of a product to retain its users over time. A product that is sticky is able to retain its users and keep them coming back, even in the face of competition. High levels of product stickiness can be a strong indicator of customer satisfaction and loyalty.One of the key ways to increase product stickiness is by improving engagement. Products that are engaging are more likely to hold the attention and interest of users, and encourage them to continue using the product over time. To increase engagement, product managers can focus on implementing features or functionality that encourage user interaction, such as social sharing or collaboration tools, or offering incentives or rewards to encourage users to use the product more frequently.Both product stickiness and engagement are important because they can have a significant impact on the success of a product or business.Photo by Alexander Shatov on UnsplashTo illustrate these concepts, consider the example of a social media platform such as Facebook. Facebook is a sticky product because it has a large user base that continues to use the platform on a regular basis, even in the face of competition from other social media platforms. It is also highly engaging, as users spend a significant amount of time on the platform, interacting with content and connecting with others. This combination of stickiness and engagement has helped Facebook to become a successful and profitable business.Product stickiness and engagement are important for a number of reasons. Here are a few key points to consider:Customer satisfaction and loyalty: High levels of product stickiness and engagement can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. Customers who continue to use and find value in a product over time are more likely to be satisfied with their experience, and are less likely to switch to a competitor’s product. Similarly, customers who are highly engaged with a product are more likely to feel a sense of enjoyment or fulfillment from using it, which can also contribute to their satisfaction and loyalty.Increased revenues and profits: A product that is able to retain its customers and attract new users is more likely to generate increased revenues and profits over time. This is especially true for products or services that rely on a subscription or other recurring revenue model, as sticky and engaging products are more likely to retain their paying customers.Competitive advantage: In a crowded market, a product that is sticky and engaging can stand out from the competition and gain a competitive advantage. Customers who are loyal to a product and highly engaged with it are less likely to switch to a competing product, which can give the product a competitive edge.Improved user experience: Products that are sticky and engaging are often able to deliver a better overall user experience, as they are able to hold the attention and interest of their users and encourage them to use the product more frequently. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty, as well as increased revenues and profits.Overall, product stickiness and engagement are important because they can have a significant impact on the success of a product or business. By focusing on improving these aspects of a product, companies can create products that are more satisfying and rewarding for their customers, and that are more likely to be successful in the long term.While stickiness and engagement are related, they are not the same thing. Stickiness is more focused on the long-term retention of customers, while engagement is more focused on the immediate interaction and usage of a product. It is possible for a product to be sticky without being particularly engaging, or vice versa. For example, a utility service such as electricity or water may be considered sticky because customers continue to use it over time, but it may not be very engaging in the sense that it is not something that customers actively seek out or enjoy using. On the other hand, a social media platform such as Facebook may be highly engaging due to the amount of time that users spend interacting with it, but it may not necessarily be considered particularly sticky if it has a high churn rate, meaning that a significant number of users stop using the platform over time.How to measure engagement and stickiness?There are several ways to measure stickiness and engagement, including the use of formulas or techniques such as customer retention rate and user activity metrics. Here are some specific examples of how these metrics can be used to measure stickiness and engagement, along with some case studies:Customer retention rate: To measure customer retention, you can calculate the percentage of customers who continue to use a product or service over a given period of time, using the following formula:Retention rate = (Number of customers at the end of the period / Number of customers at the beginning of the period) x 100For example, if you have a subscription-based streaming service with 100,000 subscribers at the beginning of a month, and 95,000 subscribers at the end of the month, your retention rate would be 95%. A high retention rate is generally considered an indicator of a sticky product, as it means that customers are continuing to use the product over time.Case study: ABC Streaming is a subscription-based streaming service that offers a variety of TV shows and movies. The company wants to measure the stickiness of its service, so it tracks the number of subscribers at the beginning and end of each month. After analyzing the data, the company finds that it has a retention rate of 95%, indicating that its service is fairly sticky. However, the company notices that its retention rate has been slowly declining over the past few months, and decides to investigate further to see if there are any issues that might be causing this trend. After reviewing customer feedback and analyzing user data, the company discovers that its retention rate has been declining due to a lack of new content and a poorly designed user interface. The company decides to invest in acquiring new content and improving the user interface, and sees an improvement in its retention rate as a result.DAU/MAU: (Daily Active Users/Monthly Active Users) is a common metric used to measure the stickiness of a product or service, particularly in the context of digital products such as mobile apps or websites. DAU/MAU is calculated by dividing the number of daily active users by the number of monthly active users.Daily active users (DAUs) are the number of unique users who interact with a product on a given day. Monthly active users (MAUs) are the number of unique users who interact with a product over a given month. By dividing the number of DAUs by the number of MAUs, you can calculate the percentage of users who are active on a daily basis compared to the total number of users who are active over a given month. This can give you a sense of how sticky a product is, as a higher DAU/MAU ratio generally indicates a more sticky product.For example, let’s say that you have a mobile app with 10,000 monthly active users and 4,000 daily active users. To calculate the DAU/MAU ratio, you would divide 4,000 by 10,000, resulting in a ratio of 0.4. This means that 40% of the app’s monthly active users are active on a daily basis. This is a relatively high DAU/MAU ratio, which could indicate that the app is fairly sticky and that a significant portion of its users are returning on a daily basis.DAU/MAU can be a useful metric for understanding the stickiness of a product, but it is important to keep in mind that it is just one metric and should be considered in the context of other metrics and user behavior data. For example, a high DAU/MAU ratio might be driven by a small group of highly engaged users, rather than a large number of users who are only occasionally active. Additionally, a low DAU/MAU ratio might not necessarily indicate a lack of stickiness if the product has a high retention rate, meaning that a high percentage of users continue to use the product over time.It’s important to note that the DAU/MAU ratio can vary depending on the type of product or service being measured. For example, a social media platform may have a relatively high DAU/MAU ratio, as users may check in and interact with the platform multiple times per day. On the other hand, a utility service such as electricity or water may have a relatively low DAU/MAU ratio, as it is not something that users actively seek out or engage with on a daily basis. As such, it is important to consider the context and characteristics of the product or service when interpreting the DAU/MAU ratio.In terms of examples and case studies, there are many examples of companies that have used DAU/MAU as a key metric for measuring the stickiness of their products. For example, in its earnings reports, Facebook frequently reports on the DAU/MAU ratio for its various products, including its main social media platform and its messaging app, WhatsApp. In its Q3 2020 earnings report, Facebook reported that its main platform had a DAU/MAU ratio of 66%, indicating that a significant portion of its monthly active users were active on a daily basis. Similarly, WhatsApp had a DAU/MAU ratio of 52%, indicating a high level of stickiness for that product as well.User activity metrics: To measure user engagement, you can track metrics such as the number of times a product is used in a given period, the amount of time spent using the product, and the number of unique users who use the product. These metrics can be tracked using tools such as analytics software or user surveys.For example, if you have a mobile app, you might track the number of daily active users (DAUs) as a measure of engagement. This would tell you how many unique users are using the app on a given day. You might also track the average session length, which is the average amount of time that users spend using the app in a single session. A longer average session length is generally considered an indicator of a highly engaging product, as it means that users are spending more time with it.Case study: XYZ App is a mobile app that offers a variety of games and puzzles for users to play. The company wants to measure the engagement of its app, so it tracks metrics such as the number of daily active users, the average session length, and the number of games played per user per day. After analyzing the data, the company finds that its app has a high level of engagement, with an average session length of 30 minutes and an average of 5 games played per user per day. However, the company notices that a small group of users account for the majority of this engagement, and decides to investigate further to see if there are any issues that might be causing this trend. After reviewing customer feedback and analyzing user data, the company discovers that a small number of games are much more engaging than the others, and decides to focus on improving and promoting these games in order to increase overall engagement.high level of engagement and high stickinessNetflix: Netflix is a streaming service that has achieved high levels of stickiness and engagement by continuously adding new content and features to its platform. In addition to offering a wide selection of movies and TV shows, Netflix has also invested in original content, such as critically acclaimed series like “Stranger Things” and “The Crown,” which have helped to drive engagement and retention. Netflix has also implemented features such as personalized recommendations and a continuous play function, which make it easier for users to find and watch content that interests them, and encourage them to spend more time on the platform.Fortnite: Fortnite is a popular battle royale game that has achieved high levels of engagement through its continuous update model, which regularly adds new content and features to the game. This has helped to keep the game fresh and exciting for users, and has encouraged them to continue playing and engaging with the game over time. Fortnite has also leveraged social media and other platforms to create a sense of community around the game, which has helped to increase engagement and retention.Spotify: Spotify is a music streaming service that has achieved high levels of stickiness and engagement by offering a wide selection of music and personalized recommendations based on users’ listening habits. Spotify has also implemented features such as the ability to create and share playlists, which have helped to increase engagement and retention by encouraging users to interact with the platform and share their music with others.Photo by Joan Gamell on UnsplashSlack: Slack is a team collaboration tool that has achieved high levels of engagement through its focus on creating a seamless and intuitive user experience. Slack has implemented features such as customizable workspaces and integrations with other tools, which have helped to increase engagement and retention by making it easy for teams to communicate and collaborate within the platform.high level of engagement but low stickinessGoogle Wave: Google Wave was a collaboration and communication platform that was launched in 2009. It was highly engaging, with features that allowed users to collaborate in real-time and share documents, images, and videos. However, it had low stickiness and was eventually discontinued in 2010 due to a lack of user adoption.Google+: Google+ was a social networking platform that was launched in 2011. It was highly engaging, with features that allowed users to connect with friends and share content. However, it had low stickiness and was eventually discontinued in 2019 due to a lack of user adoption.In these cases, high engagement was not enough to sustain the product or service over the long term. To be successful, products or services need to find ways to continue providing value and engaging users over the long term in order to improve stickiness.Overall, these examples demonstrate that there are many different ways to make a product sticky or highly engaging. By focusing on delivering value, creating a positive user experience, and fostering a sense of community, companies can create products that areProduct ManagementMetricsEngagementStickiness----More from Soroush AlaviFollowProduct Lead @JibitLove podcasts or audiobooks?

Learning a lot of new information, acronyms, tools, and skills can get overwhelming. It’s important to be patient with yourself and remember that it takes time to get up to speed in a new role. Trust your propensity to learn and figure things out over having all the right knowledge.Set goals and expectations early on — As a former competitive tennis player, I love setting and achieving goals. From my experience, it helps provide motivation, focus your efforts, track your progress, and improve your performance. Therefore, it was important for me to also set clear goals in my role as a Product Manager so I created a 30–60–90 plan with my manager where we outlined specific goals and expectations. I often referred to my plan as a way to measure progress and learnings.Take notes — With all the new information flowing in, it is important to take notes and keep these organized so you can go back and refer to them.Prioritize your tasks — Focus on the most important ones first, and if you need help clarifying what these are, ask for help. This will ensure you manage your time effectively and don’t get so overwhelmed.Seek out mentorship — Ask for help and advice from more experienced colleagues. This has proven incredibly valuable for me as they can provide support and guidance, answer questions, and point you to resources.Be adaptable and resilient — Things constantly change and it’s important to stay calm and perform under pressure. When I feel pressure, I often think about the saying by the tennis legend, Billie Jean King — “Pressure is Privilege”. This helps me frame the challenges in a positive way and remind myself that pressure often comes with responsibility, opportunity, and the chance to make a difference.Build personal relationships— This helps create a collaborative environment where people are willing to invest their time and effort in you and your team’s success.Communicate clearly and effectively — As a Product Manager it is important to clearly explain the reasoning behind decisions to keep stakeholders informed and aligned. By doing so, you can gather valuable feedback and insights that will help you make better decisions and execute effectively.On a more personal level, here are a few other things I have learned:Invest in your workspace — Two screens and an adjustable standing desk make a huge difference!Appreciate the small things — The time difference and early morning meetings can be challenging… but it also means I get to watch the sunrise every day.Adjustable standing desk and an awesome view to work fromTake breaks — One thing that has really helped me thrive in this new role is the work-life balance that living in Hawaii provides. With its beautiful beaches and outdoor activities, it’s easy to escape the stresses of work and recharge.Stay active — Tennis, volleyball, surf, yoga, hike, swim, take a walk, do something! Sometimes when it’s busy, it’s hard to get going and continue to have an active lifestyle. I have learned that this is a must have for me.Thank you for reading and I am looking forward to keep sharing my learnings as I continue my journey as a Product Manager at Tanium.Product ManagementCybersecurityItRemote Working----More from Maayan SelaFollowProduct ManagerLove podcasts or audiobooks?

Dangerous Product Management Animals Can Easily Derail TeamsBeing a Product Owner in any organization is an adventure in itself; a role that is often misunderstood. Sometimes you are expected to organize Agile product development towards management’s expectations. On other occasions, the job title is only a ‘relabeled’ Business Analyst that is expected to fulfill the roles of the Product Owner from one day to the next without any training.If you have the luck to run into ( or even be…) a Product Owner that actually owns the product you can best compare him or her with a hunter in a dark forest. Unaware of most of what is still ahead, always sharp, always focussed on:- Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;- Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;- Ordering Product Backlog items; and,- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood. — Scrum Guide 2020This is already challenging as it is but there are also some dangerous animals in the neighborhood, Product Owners have to be aware of. They are out there, lurking in the shadows. Creeping silently from bush to bush to surprise you unexpectedly. Some of them you can see coming from afar but are so strong that they can hardly be stopped. Some occur in herds so you can be overrun by their sheer number alone.But, don’t be afraid brave hunters! You can avoid them, deceive them, or even brutally defeat them with the right tactics! But let’s start at the beginning; Identification!HIPPOHighest Paid Person’s Opinion.Avinash Kaushik was the first to coin the term HIPPO in his book Web Analytics: An Hour a Day. When a HIPPO is in the room and a difficult decision needs to be made, the group will often defer to the judgment of the HIPPO. Especially when there’s no data or analysis to determine the right course of action. In many organizations, employees with the best salary and highest authority have the final say. Often they bear the most responsibility. Not infrequently, directors and managers think they know better than colleagues in lower positions. They are inclined to be guided by their own opinion, even when other employees have more knowledge within a particular field.In addition to the fact that the presence of a hippo in the organization can be demotivating for a team, there is a chance that important decisions will be made without leaving room for valuable ideas or arguments from others.No matter what way you spin it, realize that when a CEO gives his opinion, it will still be listened to more carefully than if any other person gives his opinion.The best way I have found, so far, to keep the HIPPOs in your organization under control is to include them in your product vision in time. Even though a Hippo can be a threat to self-organization in teams, you can also use it as an asset. Having a HIPPO on your side can help you a lot in achieving the best results for your product.WOLFWorking On Latest FireThe WOLF has a short attention span and the habit to jump from one problem to the next. This will disrupt your team’s focus and effectiveness, making you easy prey for not delivering what you aimed for.Think back to teams you have worked with (or even one of your current teams) and you’ll probably recognize the WOLF. Those people who jump from one thing to another, find everything important, start 6 things but almost never finish them. What was important yesterday is not anymore today and this morning’s priorities have changed this afternoon. How can you handle this WOLF?Stop starting, start finishing! — Arne RoockA very powerful tool, and if you ask my co-author Maarten Dalmijn the most important one, is the use of the Sprint Goal. In one of his many articles on the subject, ‘Sprint Goals are the beating heart of Scrum’, Maarten states that the Sprint Goal is the common denominator between all of the Scrum Events.The Sprint Goal indicates what this Sprint is all about and when and when it can be considered successful. The Sprint Goal establishes the Sprint’s right to exist. It gives the Development Team a common goal to strive for and focus for the Sprint. In addition, inspect and adapt can be applied every day during the Daily Scrum on the basis of this Sprint Goal. These are the benefits that a Sprint Goal offers.A Product Owner who considers “every story we planned need to be ‘done’ ” to be a good Sprint Goal, can just as well put the titles of all PBIs in sequence. Focus during the Sprint, having a common goal, and stimulating daily inspection and adaptation are reasons for formulating a powerful Sprint Goal.RHINOReally Here In Name OnlyThe RHINO is just there to collect a paycheck without contributing much to the team. They might not be actively impeding your decision-making, but they’re certainly not helping out much, either.Anyone who ever watches sports knows that a team is more than the sum of its parts. Team members reinforce each other. This works not only in sports but also in music or on stage and in organizations. But what distinguishes a High-Performance team from other teams? And how do you ensure that everyone is really involved in the team and the team results?A Dutch study of High-Performing teams shows that there are six characteristics that ensure that teams perform excellently and every team member is actively involved. The core elements of Scrum can be perfectly tailored to the six characteristics formulated by the authors of this study Kuipers and Groeneveld.1. EnthusiasmEveryone is equal within a Scrum Development Team. There are no functional roles and the entire team is responsible for the final result. People can share knowledge both at the beginning and at the end of a Sprint. Because of this openness, everyone feels involved with the product throughout the entire development process.2. Self-managementThe self-managing team is one of the most important principles of Scrum, especially if you look at the most recent version of the Scrum Guide. Teams use the boundaries that Scrum provides in the guide to organize the work themselves, develop initiatives, and find solutions to any problems.3. Targeted cooperationIn Scrum, the goals to be achieved are set per Sprint (Sprint Goal) and per day (Daily Scrum). Every day the team comes together for a Daily Scrum meeting where they discuss how to achieve the sprint goal together.4. Task-oriented collaborationScrum works with iterations. Work is done in periods of two to a maximum of four weeks (Sprints). During each Sprint, the team delivers a working product. Due to the short period of time, stakeholders have better insight into the progress of the project. The business stakeholders and the Development Team remain in contact with each other.5. Transformational leadershipTransformational leadership is a style of leadership in which managers focus on shared values ​​and the importance of collaboration. A Scrum Team consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers. The Product Owner is, amongst his/her many other roles, the customer’s representative. The Scrum Master has a guiding role and helps the team to follow the correct Scrum process. The responsibility for product development, therefore, rests entirely with the Developers. The Scrum Master and Product Owner ensure support within the organization.6. Stakeholder-oriented collaborationStakeholder-oriented collaboration, in which team members maintain relationships with stakeholders themselves, is essential to obtain input that is necessary for the delivery of good products and services.In Scrum, we see this collaboration in the way every Sprint Sprint starts with the Sprint Planning where the Scrum team determines which tasks the Developers will take on, in consultation with the Product Owner and the stakeholders. At the end of each Sprint, during the “Sprint Review”, the product that they are building is shown. The entire Scrum Team is present, together with all stakeholders. Because it is always possible to coordinate with stakeholders during a Sprint, contact is guaranteed and knowledge is shared with each other.ZEBRAZero Evidence But Really ArrogantZEBRAs think they know it all but rely on their instinct rather than any actual evidence.ZEBRAs are the type of people who always have the loudest voice in meetings and regularly state that they already have extensive experience in the subject. “In my previous team/company we ran into the same thing and believe me, the way it is now proposed to be solved isn’t going to work.”What helps you to deal with the ZEBRA’s in your jungle is not to keep shouting the same message more often or louder, but to gather irrefutable evidence. You will not be able to do this in one go, this also is a tactic that requires patience and caution. As soon as a ZEBRA gets wind of being stalked, it quickly joins the herd and hides there in plain sight.One of the best ways to build data and thus collect the necessary evidence is to conduct experiments.Let that be one of the responsibilities of the Scrum team and thus offer an opening to start experimenting!The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required. — The Scrum Guide 2020A good Scrum Master encourages his or her team to experiment with new methods or ideas. Nothing is permanent. If something doesn’t work you expected it to do: throw it away or try again.How?Use the retrospective for this, for example. What makes the retrospective so strong is the constant improvement loop: evaluation, devising the outcome of improvement actions and evaluating again. The trick to getting more value from the retrospective is therefore to determine and implement follow-up experiments. Always try to translate the insights you get during the retrospective into experiments that the team can pick up during the next sprint.So instead of focussing on specific retrospective actions, consider formulating experiments together!Scrum experimentThe advantage of this is that you automatically have to think about how you are going to measure whether the action is working or not. Formulating experiments also forces you to think about learning instead of just blindly jumping to actions! Think of 1 to a maximum of 3 new experiments per sprint.In the following retrospective, you can look back on how the experiment went: what impact and what effect did it have? If it has had no value or impact, you can decide not to abort the experiment before spending worthless effort on it. Better try something different based on the learnings you got out of it.So give it a try. Instead of formulating the outcome of your retro as an action, name it and try it out as an experiment.EndnoteWith this article, I hope to have helped you to recognize some of the various dangerous animals in the organizational jungle and to offer tactics to combat them. However, the jungle offers shelter to many more exotic animals. So probably there are more that have not even been discovered yet or, more likely, you have animals in your jungle that are a crossbreed between the above animals.What about a “HIPPOLF”? a crossbreed between a HIPPO and a WOLF?

We learn about metrics and testing methods that can quantify the success of a design.However, it can still be challenging to communicate the value of design to executives and other stakeholders. It often feels like an upward battle, constantly having to fight for a seat at the table while proving yourself to the skeptics.We’ve all heard stakeholders raise questions about UX, such as:How do we know if a design is on the right track?How can we measure success of a design?What value does UX design bring to the company?Why should we advocate for UX?Many stakeholders don’t understand the value of UX design and see UX as non-essential or “nice-to-have”. It’s our responsibility as designers to advocate for ourselves and communicate the value of good UX design for a few reasons.1. Justify the investmentBy demonstrating the financial impact of UX design in terms of business metrics such as revenue or profit, it becomes easier to justify the investment in UX design to stakeholders.2. Prioritize UXBy quantifying the value of UX design, it becomes easier to prioritize UX design efforts and allocate resources accordingly. This can help to ensure that UX design is given the attention it deserves in the development process.3. Measure successBy aligning business goals with UX metrics, success is clearly measurable. UX design can impact many different business outcomes, including conversion rates, customer retention, and customer lifetime value, among others. Tracking metrics can determine whether solutions are helping the business achieve its objectives.Why is it hard to quantify the value of UX?UX design plays one part in the overall product development process, making it difficult to isolate the impact of UX on specific business outcomes.There are many different UX metrics that can be used to measure the effectiveness of design, but it can be challenging to determine which metrics are most relevant and to accurately measure them.UX design can also be seen as subjective, such that what works well for one user may not work well for another. This can make it difficult to quantify the value of UX in a way that is meaningful and accurate.Demonstrating the ROI of good UX designWhat stakeholders really need to know is how UX can support and impact the business’ goals.What return will the business get for investing in UX?On a high level, to demonstrate the return on investment (ROI) of good UX design, designers should:Identify the specific business goals that UX can impactUse data and analytics to track metrics that support the business goalsThere are many UX metrics that can be important to business, depending on the specific goals and objectives of the business.Some common metrics for tracking success include:Conversion rate: The percentage of users who complete a desired action, such as making a purchase or filling out a form. Improving conversion rates can have a significant impact on revenue and profitability.Customer retention: The percentage of customers who continue to use a product or service over time. Improving customer retention can lead to increased customer lifetime value and a more stable customer base.Customer satisfaction: A measure of how satisfied users are with a product or service. High levels of customer satisfaction can lead to increased loyalty and positive word-of-mouth marketing.Time on site: The amount of time that users spend on a website or using a product. Longer time on site can be an indication of user engagement and interest.Bounce rate: The percentage of users who leave a website after only viewing a single page. A high bounce rate can be an indication of a poor user experience.By collecting data on user behaviour before and after UX changes, designers can also measure the impact of those changes on key business metrics.For example, if a website redesign resulted in a 20% increase in conversion rates, this could be used to estimate the financial impact of the redesign.Use case studies and industry benchmarksThere is a wealth of research and case studies available that demonstrate the impact of good UX design on business outcomes.Search for case studies that are relevant to your business. This might include case studies from companies in your industry, or that illustrate similar challenges or goals. Look for patterns and trends that demonstrate the impact of UX in those scenarios.Industry benchmarks can also provide a useful reference point for investing in UX design. For example, if the average conversion rate in your industry is 2%, a case study demonstrating a 20% increase as a result of UX improvements can be used to communicate the value of UX design in a compelling way.Design advocacyOverall, designers should continue advocating for UX design, as it plays a crucial role in the success of any product or service. Good UX leads to increased user satisfaction and loyalty, while poor UX can lead to frustration and abandonment.Increasing design advocacy within an organization requires a combination of education, collaboration, and a commitment to design as a key part of the development process.Educating stakeholdersIt is important to educate stakeholders about the value design can bring to an organization in order to increase support for design efforts. This can be done through design demos, research and insights presentations, and case studies that show the impact of design on business outcomes.Establishing design as a strategic partnerDesign needs to be given the attention and resources it deserves. To establish design as a strategic business partner, start by defining design principles and guidelines through a design system that your team follows. Also, regularly incorporate user research and usability testing into the development process.Fostering a culture of designBuilding a culture of design within an organization helps to increase design advocacy. This involves encouraging open communication and collaboration between designers and other stakeholders, as well as promoting design thinking and user-centered design practices.By establishing cross-functional teams, it becomes easier to involve designers in decision-making. Collaboration is key to ensuring that design considerations are taken into account and to build support for design initiatives within the organization.Thanks for reading!Be sure to SUBSCRIBE to never miss another article on UX design, career tips, life lessons, and more!Here are a few more to read next:The risks of taking shortcuts in product developmentTaking a long-term approach to balance speed and qualityuxdesign.ccThe truth about UX designer salaries in techFind out if you’re getting paid fairly and start your salary negotiation right.uxdesign.ccUXDesignProduct ManagementBusinessStartup----More from UX CollectiveFollowWe believe designers are thinkers as much as they are makers.

But as soon as most of your experienced developers change jobs and newcomers are stuck because of uncovered questions — well-described documentation is the most precious thing in the world. Here I’ll tell you how we could improve our technical documentation and include it in the CI/CD process.Tweet of @petergyangStory of an average teamBut let’s start from the beginning.As most of the usual teams, we agreed on definitions of done and there was a point “feature is described in the documentation”. It worked when we had spare time, but as soon as the workload increased — documentation was the first point that was ignored by all team members. Apart from this, let’s be honest, it is really difficult to find somebody who likes writing documentation. Usually, it’s boring, sometimes annoying and you are almost sure that nobody will ever read it, especially when it’s an internal wiki.But anyway all teams have staff turnover or they become bigger with newcomers — what usually is the first thing all new team members do? They start by reading documentation. Of course, nobody can invest a full day into a newcomer adaptation and when your documentation is outdated or some features are not described — the first days of newcomer becomes a nightmare.So one of such newcomers came to our team and we understood that our developer with QA spent about 40 hours! in general just to answer all his questions, and it was only beginning. All this information was not covered in the wiki, but most of the team members just knew it. In parallel, we also had everyday questions from our B2B clients about some tricky cases in the system and we used to answer such questions. Moreover — we created a special support chat with main clients where they could ask different questions and expect to get an answer.So one day we decided that we should start with something and we created a plan which grew into a real project.Picture from www.shutterstock.comHow to begin?First of all, we revised all features from production and which of them were described in the documentation. After detailed research, we understood that most of the articles were outdated and did not cover all scenarios. We need to cover hundreds of pages. What should be the starting point? How to prioritize? Fortunately, our small customer support team helped us with it and provided the most popular topics from our customers.After several written articles we came up with a text style and template. As a result, we agreed on the list of rules on how all instructions should be written.Step by step we were updating our google doc and one day we realized that documentation with more than 400 pages is too big. Moreover, based on the business model some features were not available to clients. In other words, some clients do not need half of our documentation. So we decided to move from Google to Notion. There are also a lot of really good wiki tools like Nuclino, Confluence, and bit.ai, but the main idea was to split documentation into separate articles with parent-child structure, role model, and other nice features like code markdown, export in different formats, etc.Definitions of DoneOne day we closed all our debts regarding documentation and it was aligned with the development process. But the main result was that all team members were involved in this process and everybody understood how important it is. At this moment documentation was our separate IT product. After such improvement, the number of requests from our customers decreased up to 70%, so this new “product” definitely started to save money on customer support. Nobody wanted to come back to past times and all of these helped us to come up with realistic Definitions of Done.According to the new DoD, all features could not be deployed without a technical documentation update. To follow this approach we agreed on the below rules:Whenever somebody creates a Jira ticket with feature acceptance criteria — the same person should create another ticket for documentation. And link these tickets!Both tickets should be done in the same sprint. So if development was done, but a ticket with documentation is still in progress — the development ticket cannot be closed. And vice versa.Both development and documentation tickets have the same priority.The main rule is that there could not be any excuses! It’s quite tempting to deploy something and promise to finish with documentation later, but it’s very addictive and can break all that was done.Practical advisesDefinition of Done is a good well-known instrument to keep the quality of your product on a high level, but it’s not enough. It took about half a year to grow this responsibility in our team and I would recommend the following some advises from my experience:Don’t forget to include additional story points on documentation during on planning meeting. It takes time and makes the development process slower, but this approach allows you to save time in the futureCreate a new role of documentation Leader in your team. This person is responsible for regular follow-ups of what’s going on with documentation and pushes team not to forget about it. This role can be passed around all team members from sprint to sprint.Use templates and simple wording, especially if this is an internal wiki. Nobody cares how many synonyms or the phraseological unit you used. It should just explain how it works.Include more screenshots. It save a time of writer because you don’t need to explain all details in words, and also it saves time of reader because one’s does not need to understand what author wanted to say.CI/CDAs soon as documentation became a part of our deployment process we started to follow versions of it. So if something was deployed to production — the version of our product was updated. And at the moment we deployed a new version of the documentation to Notion, so they were synchronized. If something went wrong — we could roll back the latest release together with documentation.As a result, we have all the time updated documentation published for our clients, with a role model, different options for export, video instructions, and other nice features popular among users.Why do you need this?It’s very difficult to start working with documentation, especially when you need to create it from scratch. But try to analyze how much time your customer support spends on routine explanations, your newcomers to understand how the system works, and even your teammates when something goes wrong. You definitely can save a lot of time and money on it.QAScrumAgileDocumentationProduct Management----1More from BootcampFollowFrom idea to product, one lesson at a time.

Effective app monetization strategies convert the user without disrupting the user experience. These strategies require careful study of your users, their behavior, and preferences before designing and implementing them. A combination of several strategies often works best.Mobile app user statisticsToday, mobile applications have become indispensable tools for business, banking, shopping, and entertainment. In 2022, the average user spends more than 5 hours in apps, which is 35% more than in 2019. And in the Apple Store and Google Play 1.96 million and 2.87 million applications are available, respectively. In fact, studies show that the average American checks their phone 344 times per day! That’s once every 4 minutes. The average smartphone owner uses 10 apps per day and 30 apps each month.In 2023, consumer spending on mobile apps is projected to reach an impressive $935 billion. The numbers don’t lie — if we really like an app or are used to it, we don’t mind paying to use it. But user loyalty is a fickle currency. App users don’t want to see ads on every screen, and app owners, in turn, want to monetize every user.Strategies and ways to monetize the app in 20231. Freemium. A free app with premium features.The model assumes a set of free basic functions, as well as additional features that can be purchased for money. For example, in the mobile version of the Zoom platform, you can connect to video conferences for free, but the conference is limited in time and the number of participants. To expand these limits, you need to pay a premium rate. Among paid features — connection of up to 500 users, cloud storage for conference records, and the possibility of online broadcasting in social networks.The main thing is to interest and attract a large number of users in order to further encourage them to buy the paid version. This method can also work well with additional strategies such as in-app advertising or purchases.When monetizing mobile apps using the Freemium model, it is necessary to understand who will buy additional features. For example, Skype offers advantageous rates for international calls, but they are paid for by about 5% of users.The loyalty of the audience remains high due to free access. But the basic features must meet the customer’s needs. The free features should be very good, then the user will be willing to buy paid access to even better features.Pros of the monetization model Freemium:Familiar to users;Ease of implementation;The app itself remains free, making it easy to acquire users and build a loyal audience.The model makes it possible to quickly gather a user base for retargeting.Unlike aggressive promotion of paid applications, Freemium forms a positive brand image.People who have tried the service before buying it are more likely to become loyal users.Cons of the monetization model Freemium:A very small percentage of users make payments;If it’s not a subscription model, there will be one payment from one user and his LTV will be just that.When choosing which features to leave free and which to provide after the purchase, it is important to maintain a balance. If there are too few basic features, the user will not stay in the app for long, and if there are too many, the user will have no incentive to buy advanced functionality.2. Ads-free. A free app with the ability to turn off ads.An alternative Freemium scheme is a paid extension that allows you to use the app without ads. Most people don’t like seeing ads in their apps, and they will be happy to remove them.You can create two versions of the app; one free version with ads included and an updated paid version without ads.3. Free Trial. Paid application with a test period of use without payment.The idea of the Free Trial is a bit like Freemium, but still different. The essence of the Free Trial is that the client downloads the application for free, and has access to all the functions of the program at once, but for a certain period. Most often — from 7 to 30 days. Trial access is considered informative. After studying the possibilities of the application, the user must decide whether to pay or refuse the application.If customers like the product, they will buy it, use it, and give positive feedback, which will attract other customers as well. It’s also a good opportunity to collect feedback from users: even if they refused to buy, they tried the product. This will help improve the app and fix bugs.4. Paid. Premium application with full functionality.In this model, monetization of the app occurs immediately upon download. This can lead to higher levels of user engagement or loyalty. However, it is important that the app has enough unique features or value to encourage the customer to make a purchase. If users don’t see how the app can meet their unique need, they are unlikely to buy a “cat in the bag.” Selling an app is appropriate if it performs one function and has no alternatives available for free.Paid apps, which must be purchased before they can be used, are much less popular. The most successful ones have been downloaded a few hundred thousand times, while the top free apps many have been downloaded hundreds of millions of times. Despite the fact that their cost usually does not exceed a few dollars, users prefer to try free counterparts. At the same time, the cost of attracting users to paid apps is increasing, making this model less and less profitable.Pros of the monetization model Paid:It’s easy to implement this model: it’s much easier to set up a one-time purchase of the app than, for example, to charge money within the app after a trial period.Very easy to use: Just add the app to the store and assign a price. The App Store and Google Play platforms will adapt the price themselves to whatever country they are available in. Instant revenue per user.People psychologically view paid apps as better products than free ones, which can help promote them.Cons of the monetization model Paid:You can’t release a “raw version”. You have to create a finished product right away. Beta versions are not suitable for distribution, because they will instantly drown in negative feedback because customers expect to receive a product of quality commensurate with the price tag.The purchase is a one-time purchase and does not bring profit from a particular user in the long run.Promotion is complicated by the very fact of paid access. In a market where most applications are distributed on a free-to-play model, it is very difficult to convince a customer to buy.The most important problem is piracy. As soon as a programmer with the appropriate skills pays for the purchase and downloads, he hacks it and puts it in the public domain. His benefit is often to integrate his advertising into the application, which may not even be there before him. But he is the one who will get the revenue from the downloads.5. Paymium or Paidmium. A hybrid paid app model with in-app purchases.A commercial solution used mainly in the game industry. The business model includes a paid installation of the game (application purchase). In addition, the possibility of buying resources, game items, or hints is built into the gameplay as additional monetization.The model is not the most common, used mainly in “iconic” games for which updates are regularly released.Games that people are familiar with, such as Minecraft, The Game of Life, and NBA 2K18, do great with a paymium strategy. Their leverage comes from great marketing and a strong reputation.6. IAP. In-app purchases.Free apps that offer in-app purchases. This model is based on the sale of virtual goods. Most often this approach is used in games, entertainment or services with built-in gamification. The user can buy accessories and clothes for his character, as well as in-game currency. Typical examples of in-app purchases could be unlocking premium characters in a mobile game or seeing who wants to send you a message in a dating app.It’s important that the buying process doesn’t interfere with the main functionality, doesn’t impose itself, but simply provides additional benefits. The user is ready to buy something within the app if he feels a real benefit for himself.Pros of the monetization model IAP:A flexible model that can be applied to a wide variety of games and services (e.g., the purchase of masks and filters in photo and video editors).In-app purchases further engage the audience and increase their loyalty. A user who has already spent their money is more likely to stay in the app for a long time.Cons of the monetization model IAP:The model will only work successfully in apps with highly engaged users who are willing to spend real money on virtual items.Google Play and AppStore deduct a commission from the sale of virtual items within apps.It’s hard to integrate in a way that doesn’t hurt gameplay or core functionality without giving the customer some benefit and getting them to shop all the time.A very small percentage of users make purchases.Virtual goods go beyond gamesA lot of new technological possibilities, in particular, the creation of NFT and meta-universes intersect with the interests of users.New trends have emerged that will clearly evolve in 2023:Apparel brands have begun to release collections in virtual and augmented reality. Some of these collections consist of unique or limited-edition items.Gaming market research confirms that demand for virtual items will rise if they find value outside of the gaming community.Users are attracted by the ability to create different virtual items and put them up for sale.7. M-commerce and services with an integrated payment system.This monetization option is called m-commerce or mobile commerce. It has naturally evolved from e-commerce and is a great strategy for selling goods and services to retailers.Apps that provide delivery, cab, and reservation services, as well as online shopping and financial services apps, accept payments through integrated payment systems. For some businesses, the mobile app is the only source of revenue, while for others it is an additional sales channel.Pros of the monetization model M-commerce:For a mobile application, you can use existing server systems.Ability to work with affiliate programs and advertisers for additional income.Mobile applications show higher sales volumes than mobile sites.Cons of the monetization model M-commerce:The costs of designing and developing a mobile app are justified only if there are large volumes of online sales.The mobile app must be flawlessly user-friendly, otherwise, customers will leave for competitors.8. Marketplaces. Getting a percentage of the deal.One kind of M-commerce monetization model is marketplaces. You create an app in which other participants are added. They interact with customers, you get a percentage of the transaction. Monetizing mobile apps by getting a percentage is very profitable, especially if the product gets popular. But you need to find a niche, develop it, provide the infrastructure for the app to work and implement systems for payment and control of financial transactions. But in spite of the complexity, the direction is promising and highly profitable.Pay-per-transaction in a free app is another way to make money. This strategy is only viable when your app users need a monetary transaction. Especially when buyers and sellers are very involved and need the marketplace to integrate with a third party. To include this feature in your app, you need to develop payment gateways.Pros of the monetization model Marketplaces:The model works “by itself”The app itself is freeIf there is mass demand, another no less profitable methods of monetization are possible (for example, in the marketplace of used cars — posting ads for money)Cons of the monetization model Marketplaces:It’s hard to find a niche and “rock” itYou need to implement payment to control processes and take your cutYou need to provide all the infrastructure and logistics, leaving the doers only the direct workYou become the face and all bad claims will be to you, not the performers9. Subscription. An application with paid access for a certain period of time.The strategy of monetizing apps by subscription applies to apps that can be downloaded for free, but require a paid subscription to access the content. Most often this model is combined with Free Trial or Freemium, because the client is unlikely to want to buy a subscription right away, without “testing” the features of the application. If the resource is interesting and the service is convenient for users, then, subject to the optimal cost of subscription, the method will be profitable.The subscription model can be profitable for service-oriented or content-oriented applications, such as music streaming services, news applications, e-book libraries, collaboration services, and CRM. Many offer tiered subscription services that try to convert lower-tier users and eventually try to resell users to higher-priced tiers. This model can provide you with consistent revenue without significantly impacting the user experience.Pros of the monetization model Subscription:Subscription provides a stable, guaranteed income.Increases LTV and user loyaltyPlatform holders are extremely interested in subscriptions. For example, Apple takes 30% of the subscription fee only in the first year, and the next year only 15%.Cons of the monetization model Subscription:This monetization model applies only to certain categories of apps.Subscription is not suitable for most apps with content that does not have regular updates.As with Freemium, it is important to strike a balance between free services to attract users and a paid version to monetize.A loyal paying audience is very difficult to gather.You need really premium content for which people would be willing to pay — and not just pay, but regularly.The comparative difficulty of technical implementation and tracking the effect of subscriptions.10. Partnership or sponsorshipAn affiliate or sponsored monetization strategy can be beneficial for niche markets. This method allows you to inform app users about other brands associated with your brand, and some offer related promotions for users. For example, a hotel booking app can partner with a car rental app to encourage users to book trips through both apps at a discounted price.One of the newest methods of monetization is sponsorship, which implies that in-app advertiser sponsors will reward certain user actions.For example, in the fitness app, users get coins for activity, which they can spend to get discounts at partner stores, as well as prizes from sponsors for certain achievements and records.Sponsor advertisers receive additional advertising and increased sales, and app owners receive affiliate rewards from sponsors.Collaborations are one of the fastest-growing trends. Interactive campaigns attract the attention not only of app users, but also of the market as a whole.For example, the North Face x Gucci and Pokémon GO collaboration has attracted a lot of media attention and interest in all the participants. In the game Pokémon GO appeared clothes from the collection of brands, in which you can dress your avatar.11. Ads. In-app advertisingIn-app advertising is one of the most common strategies for monetizing apps.You can work with advertisers directly or through intermediaries. Each region has its own popular solutions. Well-known advertising platforms include AdMob, Unity Ads, MoPub, Appodeal, InMobi, Conversant, etc.After registration, the publisher of the app gets the opportunity to place advertising banners or video ads in it. They will be seamlessly integrated into the interface of the mobile app, as if they were specifically designed for it.There are three types of ad revenue to consider when monetizing an app:- Price per thousand impressions (CPM).- Price per click (CPC)- Price per action (CPA)Pay per thousand impressions is preferred among free app developers because it doesn’t require the user to click on ads so developers can make money. The fee is less, but it is less intrusive to the user.Types of in-app advertising include:Banner adsBanners usually look like horizontal bars at the top or bottom of the app page. These ads are inexpensive and easy to embed in almost any app. The user can close the banner at any time. However, they may interfere with the user’s work or seem insufficiently large on small screens.Interactive ads (Playable ads)This is a more complex format of advertising, which appeared on the market relatively recently. But it has already become quite promising. This kind of advertising invites the user to try a mini-version of the product. For example, if the advertiser has developed a game, the user can pass the first level in it.Interstitial Ads. (Rich Interstitial)Interstitial ads are displayed as full-screen ads between streams of users, such as after passing a game level. This type of advertising provides a consistently high CTR, which is associated with actively attracting the attention of the user. Game developers should use interstitials with caution and place ads only during natural transitions and pauses between levels in the game. Low-quality interstitial ads can distract the user and reduce audience loyalty.Native advertisingNative ads are ads designed to blend seamlessly with other messages in the app. These ads often have a higher level of engagement, but it’s important that they look like ads but feel like native posts. Native banners complement the interface. These ads look natural, enhance the user experience, and are less annoying to users.Video (Video Interstitial, Rewarded Video)The most popular advertising format in applications. Video can be Interstitial or In-banner. Interstitial video can be shown in the application interface, between game levels, at the end of the text, etc. In-banner video can be activated during a standard banner display.Rewarded video viewing. In order for users to view the video, you can offer them a certain reward. For example, an extra life or a hint in the game, a ten percent discount, an extra sum in game currency or an item of equipment for the character. Usually such ads are perceived by users as a positive experience of interaction with the application, rather than as a hindrance in the process of using it.Ads list (Offerwall)Advertising in this format offers users a list of tasks that they can perform in exchange for a reward. It can be viewing ads, taking surveys and mini-games, or subscribing to free newsletters. These ads allow the user to receive premium content for free, which means increasing user retention rates at zero cost. Reward ads provide users with rewards for completing certain tasks, such as getting extra lives in a game for watching 10 seconds of advertising.Pros of the monetization model Advertising:Popular apps collect a lot of behavioral data about users’ habits and preferences, which advertisers value.It’s easier to attract users to a free app, which means you can monetize it from the start.A variety of advertising formats, which can sometimes even improve the user experience.Relative to the other models — the simplest scenario.Cons of the monetization model Advertising:Intrusive advertising can lead to a drop in loyalty and user churn.Ad blocking. If the user has an ad-blocking app installed on their phone, advertisers will be left at a loss.If ad placement is poorly implemented, it can detract from the user experience in the app.Not suitable for niche apps that solve a user’s immediate need (ordering a cab).Low revenue per user — you need a very large audience to start making money.12. Data monetization.Data monetization uses the data that users generate every time they interact with your app. You can anonymize and quantify this data so you can use it to gain valuable insights into your customers’ behaviour. Using this data can help you better understand how users interact with your app and what they like, allowing you to better market to them or meet their needs to retain them. In addition, this method rarely disrupts or affects the user experience.User data is usually needed by advertisers, telecommunications companies, research institutes, brand marketers, etc.How to choose an app monetization model?The choice of monetization method depends on the following parameters:Ability to pay and geography of salesFor example, Apple device users are more likely to pay for access to certain features than Android users. US users are much more solvent than, for example, Indian users. For a paid application, it is best to create an English version of the IOS app right away, and connect other versions later as needed.Age and tastesYou need to understand what potential users will be willing to pay money for, and what features they will not be interested in. For example, people of middle and older age agree to pay for switching off ads in the “reader”, because they understand that it is more like a copyright payment. And buying “outfits” in the shooter will be mostly young people.The demand for paid servicesUsers are not particularly willing to part with their money. And if almost everyone is ready to pay for sharing access to a business project or other solutions that contribute to making a profit, it makes no sense to charge for entertainment, music or the ability to use tools that are available for free. It’s better to set up ads and offer payment for extra convenience.App subject matter and advertisingSponsors and advertisers are willing to invest in apps, but you need to be able to interest them. It’s best to work within a specific theme. For example, sellers of goods for sports and health will sponsor a fitness app. A weather informer will be suitable for advertising consumer goods and services with a particular region in mind. And contextual advertising should be built into the cinema or an online library.It is not necessary to focus on one method of monetization, models can be combined. Some monetization models allow you to start earning immediately upon release, while others involve building revenue from monetization over time. Advertising is one of the most flexible sources of income, which is combined with all models except subscriptions. Choosing a monetization model for your app should be based on your niche and the interface of the app, as well as the characteristics of your target audience.Based on our expertise in mobile app development we can suggest the most suitable monetization model for your project as well, and then competently implement it and create an MVP ready for testing.At HF-Solution, we not only develop apps, but also help create user journey maps and effective interface designs with UI/UX best practices in mind.App DevelopmentMonetizationProduct Management----More from HF-Solution companyFollowHF-Solution was founded in 2016 and is headquartered in Minsk, Belarus.

Bill was initially tricky to deal with because I was still somewhat new to UX and had yet to learn much about metrics.He'd discuss project goals and metrics in meetings to keep us focused. He'd also shut down my design ideas, using KPIs and metrics to explain. Every action was taken in pursuit of better benchmarks.It took me a while (and a lot of struggle) to figure out how to work with him, but I was eventually able to do so after learning a little bit about his neck of the woods: metrics. Here's what I discovered.Surrogation, or the problem of the bird's-eye viewFirst of all, if you encounter this sort of person, you're not alone.In her book Just Enough Research, Erica Hall mentions that the most frequent question she gets is, ""How do I convince managers to pay attention to qualitative research when all they care about are numbers?""This phenomenon is often common enough that there's a name for it: surrogation. Surrogation is the tendency of managers to substitute metrics for meaning. And it's much more dangerous than you realize.Metrics and KPIs provide a bird's-eye view of a product, and a product's performance is often condensed into metrics on a dashboard. It's quantitative research for business people that's usually assembled from the analytics of thousands of users. But there are several problems with this.First, this bird's-eye view aggregates a ton of data, so you lose much of the nuance. For example, users spending an average of 3 minutes on a page sounds okay, but if half your users spend 1 second and the others spend 6 minutes, you won't see that detail (which might suggest something needs to be fixed).Not only that, this approach reduces users to a single metric. It undoes a lot of UX designers' work, creating personas and storyboards to put a name and face to the faceless user.But most importantly, this approach is dangerous because it doesn't ask the most critical question: ""Why."" For example, metrics might tell you that users spend a lot of time on a page, but it doesn't tell you why. This is why we need Qualitative User Research (like user testing and interviews), but getting that across to managers that think this way can take time and effort.So what exactly should you do about this?How to deal with metrics-obsessed colleaguesConsider their viewpointThere's a reason why people hold this sort of viewpoint, even if it seems crazy: it works (sort of). Businesses that raise their KPIs or meet their metrics tend to earn more money, make shareholders happy, and net your manager a fat holiday bonus. So from their viewpoint, they are correct to obsess over metrics (especially if their bonus depends on it).However, that approach isn't quite right either. Often, chasing after metrics results in short-term gain at the cost of long-term user satisfaction. Unfortunately, this also usually results in a lot of technical or UX Debt to chase after performance metrics.But understanding this viewpoint helps us understand our approach: if this is what they care about, we need to ensure that the business is aware of the impact good design decisions have on metrics.The best UX Designs don't just result in 'qualitative' improvements (i.e., it tests better): it often moves the metrics after it's made public. This is because metrics are often the 'input' and 'output' of the project: poor metrics cause something to be re-designed and looked at, while good metrics are what the business wants at the end of the UX Design and research process.So you need to show the way you set up your argument.If you can, use Analytics to highlight problems in the processMetrics often play a significant role in your being assigned a project. If a project produces poor metrics (or users are vocal about their unhappiness), the business will find the budget to re-design it. Or, if they discover a customer need for a new feature, they'll gather resources to design it.That same logic can help highlight problems that Designers can solve. I've written a book about Designers and Analytics, so I will only go into a bit of detail. However, here are some ideas of what you can highlight if you choose to learn a bit about Analytics:According to the behavioral flow map, users don't access this particular page or feature. This might be a problem with the navigation.According to time spent on a page, users spend twice as long on this page compared to others.According to user engagement, we're losing way more users than average when going from the 1st page to the 2ndHow to design with dataHowever, learning Analytics can be intimidating, especially when you're getting started. That's why you don't necessarily have to learn it to use this type of argument. Instead, we can use UX KPIs (like User Error Rate) and the Google HEART framework to set up similar arguments.https://measuringu.com/heart-framework/However, Analytics and metrics can be hard to grasp if you're unfamiliar with them. Using them can make your usability problems more understandable, but there are other ways.You can also make use of a business term, forecasting.Communicate your design solution as a method of forecastingIf you do qualitative user research (like interviews and testing), it can be challenging for your managers to understand your methods.I've been questioned why I only test with five users, even though we know that it finds 85% of usability issues.However, I found my answer to these issues in an unlikely place: finance. There's a term called forecasting, which is about making informed guesses about specific business metrics to predict the future.https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forecasting.aspBusiness people understand this because they make these predictions when rolling out products, fighting for market share, and more. So we can use that same model to get them to understand our design solutions.Saying, ""Based on our user research, we expect X problem to be a significant issue that we must resolve or face user backlash."" can help to set the stage for your recommendations.One of the fundamental differences between qualitative and quantitative research is statistical significance. You don't have enough users (when you test with five users) to say, ""Changing X will result in a 15% increase in Metric Y"", which is often what metrics-focused managers want.However, the forecasting mindset accepts that there is little uncertainty in predicting the future, allowing them to process it better. In addition, modeling our design recommendations based on past user behavior is similar to making a business prediction based on historical data.The key to this approach is to use words like 'predict' and 'expect' in your explanations to pair with your data. So, for example, rather than saying, ""3 out of 5 users encountered this problem"" (a fact), you might say, ""we predict that a lot of users will run into this problem due to 3 out of 5 users encountering this problem."" This tends to pair well with Data Visualizations or highlight videos since we use data points as the basis of our' forecasting'.I admit it's not the usual way to explain my findings. However, learning to communicate usability issues and recommendations to specific audiences has been one of the essential skills I've had to learn to get my team on board. Whether it's metric-obsessed managers or waterfall-based developers, adapting how you explain things will significantly affect whether your ideas are accepted.Ultimately, projects are a series of design decisionsWhat's important to remember is that, ultimately, we want to ensure that the right design decisions are made for a project.As a result, you and your metrics-obsessed colleagues must come together and make the right decisions. While it might be nice to work with colleagues that understand UX, sometimes you need to reach across the aisle to relate user needs to business terms they're more familiar with.While metric-obsessed managers might be a headache to deal with sometimes, it's essential to ensure that you can get through to them and get them on board with your design decisions.So if you're working with someone who seems to only care about metrics, don't despair: use their understanding and mindset to get your design ideas approved.Kai Wong is a Senior UX Designer, Design Writer, and author of the Data and Design newsletter.

They are strong leaders who developed many early e-commerce solutions and laid the foundation of the digital world we build products on today. This post packages the themes/truths they’ve shared with me over time, and that I’ve validated through my own experience. Together they form a PM Mindset that blends empathy, emotional intelligence, and logic to help you start identifying needs and building amazing products.The PM Mindset is rooted in these four dimensions:Obsessing about your customersFalling in love with problemsConsidering the impact of your actionsConnecting your work to the bigger pictureAnyone can apply this mindset to their day-to-day lives, regardless of their role. Flexing these muscles can be a powerful first step in developing a PM career as well.Obsessing about your customersCustomer obsession seems like a no-brainer, but I’m constantly surprised by the number of people who want to get into PM and are not thinking about customers. Customers are the gateway to realizing great products, and if you interact with customers in any way, then you can start thinking and acting like a PM today. Obsess over your customers: talk to them, take a walk in their shoes, listen to their feedback, and empathize with them. Once you’ve immersed yourself in the customer’s experience, it’s time to identify and describe the problems they have. Get clear on those and you can use your expert knowledge of their needs and experience to craft solutions that actually have an impact.Falling in love with problems“What problem are you trying to solve?” — my mentor would ask me this constantly in my early career. She hammered it into my head and it’s proven true again and again: without knowing the problem, you can’t expect to craft or implement a meaningful solution. Take note the next time you’re talking with colleagues how often they jump right to solutions, without getting clear on the problem. Get super clear on your problem and the solution is often much easier than you expected. There are lots of ways to go about this like asking The Five Whys. My advice is to tattoo this question on your brain, ask it often, and be honest with yourself if you really know what problem you’re working on. You will save tons of wasted work and frustration over the years by doing this.Considering the impact of your actionsWhat are the butterfly effects of the choices we make? Sometimes giving a customer what they want is actually robbing Peter to pay Paul. If you’ve obsessed about your customers and their experience, then you’re completely aware of and considering the impacts on how your choices will ripple across your systems, teams, and customer experience. I try to make sure my goals and measures are balanced across at least two dimensions. Something like: implementing X feature will increase conversations by Y% while maintaining a Z% rate of customer contacts. The enhancement or change isn't a success until we validate the outcome in both areas.Connecting their work to the bigger pictureProduct Management is the crossroads of customer needs and organizational objectives. A company is a gigantic ship that your senior leaders are trying to steer toward sustainable growth and profitability. What direction is your organization headed? How does your work (PM and non-PM related) plug into and contribute to those objectives? Now consider the problem you’ve identified, the impact it has, and the customers that it reaches — does delivering your solution align with the ultimate goals of the organization? If so, you’re gonna find plenty of folks internally who would support the effort. If not, you’ll be pushing in a direction opposite the herd, and detracting from the momentum of the larger group. Being a PM is not only about determining what to do next, it’s often about determining what NOT to do next. Make sure the capacity you spend always supports the customers and goals of the organization.Build your PM muscle by thinking like oneThe best PMs bring this mentality to the problems they solve and the decisions they make. When PMs hear non-PMs talking and thinking like this, their ears perk up — it’s infrequent to find candidates that are naturally wired this way. Start building these muscles and thought patterns today. As a result, you’ll be on the path to becoming a great PM if that’s what you want to be. It takes reps, but you can do it, and you can start today.My last suggestion to complement the PM mindset is to be curious. Curiosity motivates us to go deeper, whether it’s investigating a problem or learning more about a customer, or ourselves. Let your curiosity run wild. Read and engage with as much material as you can. A PM mindset complemented by natural curiosity will make you stand out in the crowd. It won’t be long before you catch someone’s eye, and your first PM opportunity presents itself to you.Good luck, you can do it, you’ve already begun!Product ManagementProblems And SolutionsCustomer ExperienceProduct DevelopmentProduct Mindset----More from Luke PlikaitisFollowWildly resourceful in leading product development teams and delivering value to customers.Love podcasts or audiobooks?

Despite a turbulent macro backdrop, we’ve seen relatively strong performance for vertical SaaS companies in public markets, a wave of industry software M&A, and a herd of new vertical SaaS unicorns has joined the stable. We learned a lot as we navigated the ups and downs of the past 12 months, and we’ve loved sharing these learnings with you through this newsletter. To close out 2022, we rounded up some of our readers’ favorite stories from the past year. If you’re a new subscriber and want to go deeper, you can find the complete archive of Vertical SaaS Newsletters here.Vertical SaaS: It’s All About ControlHow can vertical SaaS companies avoid the trap of becoming just one of a multitude of applications customized for a particular industry? By building the vertical application at a control point in the customer’s workflow. We break down some key control points that founders can leverage to become the dominant SaaS provider in their industry.Vertical SaaS Moats, Part 1: Economies of ScalePart 1 in our ongoing series about Vertical SaaS moats: what they are, why they work, and how to build them. In this instalment, Fractal senior associate Evan Gabriel dives deep into the dynamics of economies of scale and how vertical SaaS companies can use this moat to create strong competitive advantages. If you liked this essay, be sure to check out part 2 in the series on network effects.Lessons from Toast on Multiproduct Vertical SaaSIn the rapidly growing pantheon of vertical SaaS success stories, few companies loom larger than Toast, which provides an “operating system” for the restaurant industry. In this essay, we explore Toast’s journey from a consumer-facing restaurant app to an operating system for the dining industry, and the lessons that vertical SaaS founders can take from Toast’s impressive strategic decisions.The Reality of Raising Capital for the First TimeIn 2022, VCs deployed more than $20B into pre-seed and seed rounds, which may give new entrepreneurs the impression that it’s easy to raise initial capital for their business. But these eye-popping numbers conceal a difficult truth: Raising your first round of capital is — and always has been — extraordinarily difficult. To understand why, it’s worth looking at a typical founder journey in the world of pre-seed investing.Lessons from Flexport for Building a Vertical SaaS UnicornWhile Flexport may not be a vertical SaaS company, the fact that it is transforming the shipping industry’s workflows as a tech-enabled freight forwarder makes it a great case study for vertical SaaS companies operating in the logistics industry or any other sector. These were our 6 takeaways from Flexport’s meteoric rise and how vertical SaaS founders can adapt these strategies for their own companies.Why Vertical SaaS Companies Outperform During a RecessionFor aspiring founders who have only known a bull market, the possibility of a recession can be frightening. But not all startups will face the same headwinds during an economic downturn, and vertical SaaS businesses in particular have properties that allow them to outperform consumer and horizontal SaaS against an unfavorable macro backdrop.

For example, leveraging current solutions that have proven successful with current customers can seem like an easy way to achieve this goal. However, this approach can also be dangerous, as it prevents you from looking strategically at the situation. You might be building the product your existing customers want but not the product your future customers will want.I witnessed this phenomenon first hand. About five years ago I helped, as a consultant, to a company that had a successful on-premise product. They recognized the emerging trend of software as a service (SaaS) in their space and decided to pivot in that direction. However, building a new SaaS-optimized solution from scratch can be a difficult and time-consuming process. As a result, the company was tempted to take a shortcut by hosting their on-premise product on behalf of each customer and adding only a small layer of SaaS to give the appearance of a SaaS product.The original plan was to refactor the service gradually, moving from instance per tenant, to a multi-tenant. They also had a big plan for retiring features that are more optimized for on-premise, in favor of rapid development of simpler feature set and user interactions that are more optimized to the SaaS model.The reality is that once the initial release of the SaaS solution happened, the strategic plans were not executed. The company’s initial SaaS revenue came mostly for existing customers that wanted a SaaS delivery. This dictated a focus on more complex features that these customers were using for years.Five years later, I happened to read about their then small competitor, going IPO and growing fast after the IPO. While the company I consulted to remained with roughly same customer base, roughly two third still on-premise, largely regarded as a “legacy vendor”.While the approach the company took, may have worked in the short term, it became quickly a dangerous trap. By not fully committing to the pivot to SaaS and continuing to support their on-premise product, the company diluted their focus and resources. This led to a slower rate of progress and a decline in quality, as the company tried to support both SaaS and on-premise customers with a single product that was not designed for either audience.In order to avoid these pitfalls, it is important for companies to be proactive and strategic in their approach to change. If a pivot is necessary, it is important to fully commit to the process and deliver all of the milestones required to make the change. This may require making difficult decisions and potentially alienating some existing customers, but the long-term benefits of a successful pivot can far outweigh these short-term challenges.In conclusion, taking shortcuts in business and product management can be tempting, but it is often a dangerous trap. By fully committing to change and delivering all of the necessary milestones, companies can successfully navigate pivots and stay ahead of the competition.Product ManagementPivoting----More from EzborgyFollowi code therefore i am.Love podcasts or audiobooks?

By analyzing data, product managers can identify trends, understand customer behavior, and measure the effectiveness of different strategies and features.In this story, we will go through five essential data metrics of which product managers should be aware. We will learn what should we track in those data metrics and why they are important to the business.The top five metrics that a product manager should track will depend on the specific goals and objectives of the product. However, some common metrics that are often relevant for product managers include:User EngagementUser engagement data metrics are measures that help product managers understand how users are interacting with the product. These metrics can provide insight into whether users are finding the product valuable and useful help identify areas for improvement.Examples of metrics that might be included in user engagement data include:Active user count: This is the number of users who have used the product within a specific time period, such as a day, week, or month.Session duration: This is the length of time that users spend using the product in a single session.Frequency of use: This is the number of times that users interact with the product within a specific time period.Retention rate: This is the percentage of users who continue to use the product over time.Bounce rate: This is the percentage of users who leave the product after only visiting a single page or completing a single task.By tracking these metrics, product managers can understand how users are interacting with the product and identify any potential issues or areas for improvement. For example, if the active user count is low or declining, the product manager may need to consider changes to make the product more appealing or valuable to users. If the session duration is short, the product manager may need to consider ways to make the product more engaging or sticky to keep users coming back.Conversion rateConversion rate data metrics measure the percentage of users who complete a desired action, such as making a purchase or signing up for a service. These metrics are important for product managers because they can help understand the effectiveness of the product in achieving its goals.Examples of metrics that might be included in conversion rate data include:Purchase conversion rate: This is the percentage of users who make a purchase after visiting the product’s website or app.Sign-up conversion rate: This is the percentage of users who create an account or sign up for a service after visiting the product’s website or app.Lead generation conversion rate: This is the percentage of users who provide their contact information or request more information about a product or service after visiting the product’s website or app.By tracking these metrics, product managers can understand how effective the product is at achieving its goals and identify any potential issues or areas for improvement. For example, if the purchase conversion rate is low, the product manager may need to consider changes to the product’s pricing, marketing, or sales process to increase the likelihood of users making a purchase. If the sign-up conversion rate is low, the product manager may need to consider changes to the product’s onboarding process or the value proposition being offered to users.Customer SatisfactionCustomer satisfaction data metrics measure how happy and satisfied customers are with the product. These metrics are important for product managers because they can help understand how well the product is meeting the needs of its users and identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.Examples of metrics that might be included in customer satisfaction data include:Net Promoter Score (NPS): This is a measure of customer loyalty and satisfaction, calculated by asking customers to rate their likelihood to recommend the product to others on a scale of 0 to 10.Customer satisfaction survey scores: This is a measure of customer satisfaction based on responses to a survey that asks customers to rate their overall satisfaction with the product.Customer support request volume: This is a measure of the number of requests for help or support that customers make to the product team.Customer churn rate: This is the percentage of customers who stop using the product within a specific time period.By tracking these metrics, product managers can understand how well the product is meeting the needs of its users and identify any potential issues or areas for improvement. For example, if the NPS score is low, the product manager may need to consider changes to the product to make it more appealing or valuable to users. If the customer satisfaction survey scores are low, the product manager may need to consider changes to the product’s features or customer support process. If the customer support request volume is high, the product manager may need to consider changes to the product to make it easier to use or more intuitive.RevenueRevenue data metrics measure the financial performance of the product. These metrics are important for product managers because they can help understand the financial health of the product and identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.Examples of metrics that might be included in revenue data include:Total revenue: This is the total amount of money that the product has generated from sales, subscriptions, or other sources.Average revenue per user (ARPU): This is the average amount of money that each user generates for the product over a specific time period.Lifetime value (LTV): This is the estimated total amount of money that a user will generate for the product over their lifetime as a customer.Cost of goods sold (COGS): This is the direct costs associated with producing and selling the product, such as materials, labor, and manufacturing costs.By tracking these metrics, product managers can understand the financial health of the product and identify any potential issues or areas for improvement. For example, if the total revenue is declining, the product manager may need to consider changes to the product’s pricing, marketing, or sales strategies. If the ARPU is low, the product manager may need to consider ways to increase the value of the product to users. If the LTV is low, the product manager may need to consider changes to the product’s features or customer support process to increase customer loyalty. If the COGS are high, the product manager may need to consider ways to reduce costs or increase efficiency in the production process.Cost per AcquisitionCost per acquisition (CPA) data metrics measure the cost of acquiring a new customer. These metrics are important for product managers because they can help understand the effectiveness of different marketing and sales efforts and identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.Examples of metrics that might be included in CPA data include:Marketing CPA: This is the cost of acquiring a new customer through marketing efforts, such as advertising, social media, or email campaigns.Sales CPA: This is the cost of acquiring a new customer through sales efforts, such as outbound sales calls or in-person presentations.Customer acquisition cost (CAC): This is the total cost of acquiring a new customer, including both marketing and sales efforts.By tracking these metrics, product managers can understand the effectiveness of different marketing and sales efforts and identify any potential issues or areas for improvement. For example, if the marketing CPA is high, the product manager may need to consider changes to the product’s marketing strategy or targeting to increase the efficiency of marketing efforts. If the sales CPA is high, the product manager may need to consider changes to the product’s sales process or the value proposition being offered to potential customers. If the CAC is high, the product manager may need to consider ways to reduce costs or increase the efficiency of marketing and sales efforts.Product managers should start tracking these metrics as soon as possible, as they can provide valuable insights into the performance of the product and help guide decision-making. However, it’s important to carefully consider which metrics are most relevant for the product and its goals and to track these metrics consistently over time to thoroughly understand their trends and patterns.Written with the help of AI.

After all, if the product isn’t meeting the needs or desires of potential customers, it’s likely to struggle to gain traction and achieve success.Photo by Boxed Water Is Better on UnsplashHowever, while product fit is certainly important, it’s not the only factor that determines the success of a business or product. In fact, the market itself can often be just as important, if not more so, than the product fit.Here are a few reasons why market is more important than product fit:The size and potential of the market can impact the potential success of a product.If the market is large and there is strong demand for the product, it may be easier to achieve success, even if the product itself isn’t a perfect fit. On the other hand, if the market is small or there isn’t much demand for the product, it may be more challenging to find success, even if the product is a good fit for the market.2. Market trends and changes can also impact the success of a product.Even if a product is a good fit for the market at the time of launch, market trends and changes can shift over time, potentially affecting the demand for the product. As a result, it’s important to be aware of market trends and be willing to adapt and pivot as needed in order to stay relevant and successful.3. Market competition can also play a role in the success of a product.If the market is already crowded with similar products, it may be more difficult to stand out and achieve success, even if the product itself is a good fit for the market. On the other hand, if the market is relatively untapped or there is little competition, it may be easier to achieve success with a product, even if it’s not a perfect fit for the market.In short, while product fit is certainly important, the market itself can often have a greater impact on the success of a business or product. As a result, it’s important to carefully consider both the product fit and the market when launching a new business or product, and be willing to adapt and pivot as needed in order to succeed.Product ManagementMarketing----More from Aina MohdFollowFull Stack Digital MarketerLove podcasts or audiobooks?

We come across various requests from organization departments and issues from users daily.Having a proper handle on these requests/issues can help determine the success of our products.To do so, defining what each request/issue is would help in prioritizing how we go about resolving them.An issue report can be broken down into 3 parts;BugsChange requests/new featuresEnhancement/optimizationBugs- These are show stoppers, they are issues that prevent a user from completing an activity.E.g- the login button not being functional, that is when a user clicks login, he can’t gain access to a platform.Not all bug issues are critical, they can be further broken down in order of severity. Some bug issues could have low severity depending on their use case, for instance for a platform that users don’t have access to, if the login button doesn’t work, it’s not exactly a show-stopper at that point.Change Request/ New Feature- These are issues that when brought up, the resolution is usually the development of a new feature, this could be as a result of a change in scope of what the initial feature(s) was supposed to achieve or not scoping end-to-end the full functionality of the feature.When issues like these are brought up, they are further categorized using any of the popular prioritization models-Prioritization matrix (effort vs benefit)Effort vs Benefit Matrix2. MoSCoWMoSCoW3. Kano Model4. Weighted scoringExample of a change request- In a delivery app product, a feature that allows a user to know the weight of a parcel for delivery.Enhancement/Optimization- These are issues that don’t affect the functionality of a feature but instead enhance or complete what it can do. E.g, creating extra validations for a feature, taking a calendar date feature, for instance, setting previous dates to raise an error or post dates to raise an error.Enhancement/Optimization can also be classified based on how soon it needs to be shipped or the impact it has on the direct feature.Using the above categorization helps in prioritizing the task activities that are shared in teams and how they are to be delivered for the success of the product.Till next time, I recommend this link if you want to read more articles from meLook out for more articles from me ✌🏽BugsFeaturesProduct ManagementProduct DevelopmentProduct Manager----More from Theresa NwandikoFollowI am a Product Manager that enjoys making development easier for engineers, QA, fellow PMs alsoLove podcasts or audiobooks?

An interesting way to quantify the… | by Divjot Singh | Dec, 2022 | MediumDivjot SinghFollowDec 22·5 min readPsych FrameworkAn interesting way to quantify the unquantifiable — user’s feelingsPsych is a way to measure a person’s level of excitement about an experience, with zero being no excitement and the maximum level being very excited. Measuring psych can help with identifying and communicating about growth experiments, as well as finding new ones. Psych framework can help you re-think not only your onboarding flow, but also how returning users feel when they use your product.source: 44 UX Case Studies To Improve Your Product Skills (growth.design)Once you track psych score throughout customer journey, you will see observe both ups and downs of customer excitement.How to use Psych Framework?One possible way to use the concept of psych to drive growth is to track changes in a person’s level of excitement over time, using a “psych tank” visualisation tool. By analysing changes in psych, it may be possible to identify which aspects of the experience are most impactful on a person’s level of excitement, and to target those areas for improvement in order to drive growth.It may also be possible to use psych to identify opportunities for growth by comparing the psych levels of different groups of users. For example, if one group of users is consistently more excited about the experience than another group, it may be possible to identify what is driving that difference and to apply those learnings to improve the experience for the less excited group.Example of a framework for adding/reducing psych scoresCore ConceptsPsych Score — An arbitrary number that you either add / remove based on positive or negative feelings that users feel when they experience different UX elementsPsych Tank — Total psych score during the customer journeyStart with an arbtrary psych score. This need not be 100% arbritary though. For example, if a user is starting to use a B2B compliance training software, psych score is already low — there would be literally zero excitement. However, for a food delivery app, when user starts signing up users would be generally excited.So you can start with -10 psych score on B2B compliance training product and +30 psych score on food delivery app. Starting from this score, keep adding or removing psych scores based on user interaction. This can also be used not just for onboarding flow, but also for returning users.Starting with some data points, if possibleImagine that a company has developed a new online platform that allows users to plan and book travel vacations. The company wants to increase the number of users and the frequency with which they use the platform, in order to drive growth.The product team might use the concept of “psych” to measure and understand the level of excitement that users have about using the platform. To do this, they might ask users to rate their level of excitement on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 being no excitement and 10 being maximum excitement, at various points during their experience with the platform.By tracking changes in users’ psych levels over time, the company could identify which aspects of the platform are most impactful on users’ level of excitement. For example, they might find that users are more excited when they see a wide range of options for destinations and activities, or when they receive personalised recommendations based on their interests.Using this information, the product team could then target these areas for improvement in order to increase users’ excitement and engagement with the platform. For example, they might add features that allow users to easily compare different vacation options, or implement a recommendation system that takes into account users’ interests and preferences.PitfallsThe concept of “psych” is a way of measuring and understanding a person’s level of excitement about an experience, with the goal of using that understanding to drive growth. While this approach may have some potential benefits, there are also some potential pitfalls or weak points to consider:Subjectivity: Measuring psych relies on subjective ratings provided by individuals, which can be affected by a variety of factors such as mood, attention, and motivation. This subjectivity can make it difficult to accurately measure and compare psych levels between different people or groups.Limited scope: Psych may only be relevant to certain types of experiences or products. For example, it may be less relevant for functional or utilitarian products that are not designed to be particularly exciting or engaging.Difficulty of interpretation: It may be challenging to interpret and use psych data effectively, as it is not always clear what specific actions or changes will result in an increase or decrease in psych.Limited focus on user experience: While psych may provide some insights into the user experience, it may not capture all of the factors that contribute to a person’s level of excitement or engagement. There may be other important considerations, such as usability, functionality, or price, that are not captured by psych measurements.Probably better for an experienced UX professionals: For an experienced UX professional, this might be a good tool as they can converge all their understandings to quantify impact on user’s psych scores. Even for them, it will be difficult to reliably cover all these UX factorsImprovements to the existing frameworkHere are some potential ways to improve the concept of “psych” as a tool for understanding and driving growth:Use multiple methods of measurement: In order to improve the accuracy and reliability of psych measurements, it may be useful to use multiple methods of measurement, such as self-report surveys, behavioral data, and physiological measures.Collect data from a representative sample: In order to ensure that psych measurements are representative of the larger population, it may be important to collect data from a diverse and representative sample of users.Consider external factors: In order to more accurately understand the causes of changes in psych, it may be useful to consider external factors that could be impacting users’ levels of excitement, such as their current mood or external events that may be influencing their behavior.Use other data sources: In addition to psych measurements, it may be useful to consider other data sources, such as user feedback, usage data, and other metrics, in order to get a more comprehensive understanding of user behavior and drive growth.Overall, by using a combination of multiple measurement methods, representative samples, and other data sources, and by considering external factors and using psych data in conjunction with other tools and approaches, it may be possible to improve the usefulness and effectiveness of the concept of “psych” as a tool for understanding and driving growth.Suggested resourcesDarius Contractor — Psych Framework — YouTubeIncrease funnel conversion with Psych | by Darius Contractor | Darius’ Thoughts (medium.com)44 UX Case Studies To Improve Your Product Skills (growth.design)UXProduct ManagementProduct ManagerDesign----More from Divjot SinghFollowEd-tech.

The most important of which is to define your Problem Statement for the sprint team.Problem Statements help everyone understand the purpose of the sprint. They are inspiring, to the point, easy to understand, and most importantly time bound.Personally I like the below framework:Action + Output + For User Type + To Solve User Problem + By DeadlineWhere each italicized variable is defined as:Action — is verb that describes what you will be working on during the sprint. Use words like reimagine, design, prototype, etc.Output — is what you will create during the sprint. For example, will the team reimagine an app, design a web experience, prototype a tablet or something similar.User Type — is who the output is for. For instance, Millennial Moms, Gen Z College Students, or perhaps New Grads asipring to become Product Managers.User Problem — is what the output should solve for the User Type. An example might be Lose Weight, Get an Entry Level Job, or Create a Viral Video.Deadline — is when your organization needs to achieve the Output that solves the User Problem. For example, End of Q2, or a specific date like January 30, 2023.When you put it all together you will have a Problem Statement like the below:Reimagine the iOS Wordle Experience For Millennial Moms To Reduce Frustration by January 30, 2023.As you are writing your Problem Statement, keep in mind that the best statements areFoolproofInspiringContain UrgencyI look forward to reading how you use this framework in the comments, or on LinkedIn.

User Empathy according to Toptal is about seeing problems and experiences through the eyes of users. While every Product Manager claims to know their users and empathise with them, they make some common mistakes. I have tried to highlight few here:User Empathy is not about Agreeing or CommittingWhile conducting user research or going through feedback, a user may state some problems and at times state some solutions as well. It is the responsibility of a Product Manager to Listen -> Analyse -> Take a call if the problem statement is a one off case or something that needs attention. Look at solving a problem that 80% users are facing and attack the problem accordingly. Users should not prioritise a task for you, there are prioritisation algorithms that help you achieve the same.As Henry T Ford famously said “If you asked users what they want, they would ask for faster horses and not cars“User Empathy is not about sharing your opinionWhile conducting user interviews, it is figuratively a sin to share your opinion while collecting user feedback. By giving your opinion, you are creating a bias. An interview should purely be to understand the stated and unstated preferences of a user. Do not skew the interview by sharing your opinions, views or suggestions.User Empathy cannot start with judgementLet’s be clear, you and your user would not have the same level of domain / product understanding. There will be cases where your user may not understand some concepts, jargons or features. It is your responsibility to dummy down the concept and explain it to them. At no given time, one should disregard a user feedback (again you may not prioritise the request but you cannot disregard).User behaviour changes based on multiple factors and constant feedback loop is neededLike an expiry date for any edible product, user behaviour also has an expiry period. You need to constantly converse with your users to understand if your product needs an update. There needs to be a constant loop of collecting feedback and conducting user studies. Note that feedback expiry may vary depending on the domain, stage of the product, type of product and other factors.Pic credits: Centre for Behaviour ChangeFocus on 80% users and come back to 20% users laterWhile all users are important, considering bandwidth and opportunity cost, always prioritise tasks / features that affect 80% of the audience. If you are hampering experience of 80% users by trying to focus on the 20% users, you are making a BIG mistake. Remember you can’t satisfy everyone. Focus on majority of the audience and ensure their experience is top notch so you can retain those 80% for life.Please share your feedback or pointers if I have missed out on any in the comments.User EmpathyProduct ManagementUser ResearchProductProduct Design----1More from BootcampFollowFrom idea to product, one lesson at a time.

We must know we are solving the right problem, for the right user, with the right solution based on the right assumptions. That’s a lot of things we have to get right.To add fuel to the fire, it’s more common to have too few UX specialists on board than too many of them.One of the solutions to get adequate research done is to engage the whole team in the process. This approach is known as UX research democratisation.However, it’s hard to discuss such a vague and broad term. To make it more tangible, I usually distinguish four different types of user research democratisation.The goal of this article is to present a clear framework that makes conversations about UX research democratisation easier.Level 1: Democratising AccessGraphic provided by the author.The simplest and most common type of user research democratisation is making research artefacts accessible to everyone.It allows everyone access:interview recordingssurvey resultsusability test resultsraw dataand so onBut access is not everything.It’s also about building a team culture that encourages using these artefacts to generate insights and kickstart discussions.Democratizing UX: how to spread UX insights throughout your organization | UserZoomThere are plenty of business cases for sharing user research.

If a QA is unsure about the latest feature, they can schedule an ad-hoc usability session, or if a developer wants to understand better the problem they are solving, they can arrange a user interview.It elevates UX researchers closer to coaches and strategic research managers than the ones who plan specific research activities.Whether such a level of democratisation should even be desirable is another question.Let’s face it. It probably won’t work in the majority of cases. But for small teams of people with proper research skills, it could bring exciting outcomes. Or at least it’s a pretty interesting theory.Prosraises UX researchers to the role of coaches, teachers and strategic managershigh team empowerment leading to a boost in motivationConsreduces the oversight of the UX research process, which might lower its qualitylack of centralised coordination might lead to a suboptimal research plan and duplicate studiesFinding balanceAll these levels require delicate balancing.You can’t replace the years of training and experience required to do the job well with democratisation. Not everyone can become a researcher.But on the other hand, you don’t need a professional user researcher for every occasion.Use various levels of democratisation to free your researchers from mundane, low-importance work and allow them to focus on critical aspects of the job.Non-researchers could focus on activities which don’t require strong research skills and whose outcomes aren’t game-changing for the product. For example:weekly exploratory interviewsobserving sales callsreading customer ticketsconducting moderated usability testsThis would allow your skilled researchers to focus more on the critical work, such as:early product discoveryverifying core assumptionsplanning discovery/research strategyAt the end of the day, the goal of UX research democratisation isn’t to make everyone a UX researcher but to make UX research happen everywhere.The goal of UX research democratisation isn’t to make everyone a UX researcher but to make UX research happen everywhere.UX DesignUX ResearchProduct ManagementProduct DesignUser Research----More from UX CollectiveFollowWe believe designers are thinkers as much as they are makers.

The job has so many facets that it is difficult, especially for starters, not to get lost in a sea of challenges. I was thrown in at the deep end myself and participated in the Digital Product School. A unique program to develop your product skills and at the same time work with well-known industry partners to create innovative products. After completing the program, I figured why not take some time to reflect on what I learned. The Internet is full of resources to learn about Product Management. But there were still a few things I learned that I was surprised about myself and probably wouldn’t have read anywhere else. Here they are:To develop product & user sense, you need to balance a clear discovery approach with speed.Photo by LinkedIn Sales Solutions on UnsplashI always thought that without a clear overview of possible hypotheses and problems, it would be difficult to properly classify and interpret the results of user research. I felt that if you didn’t consistently build on previous findings, you could miss a lot. In the worst case, you could even steer the team in the wrong direction. Of course, a certain amount of structure and documentation is necessary to do good research. Looking back now, I’m surprised at how much it helped us to move quickly and conduct lots of interviews and tests, even if we couldn’t evaluate 100% of the interviews from the previous iteration. By going fast, we looked at many different angles and thus developed good user intuition. Even if not all results are summarized or an interview doesn’t always confirm the most pressing hypothesis, it gave us a good user understanding & empathy that we brought together in the end. Along the lines of if you ask a lot of questions, you’ll get a lot of insights and hence build a comprehensive intuition for your user and product. I had to learn to trust that the pieces of the puzzle will eventually fall into place, even if you don’t always see it right away.Small experiments in many different forms paint a meaningful picturePhoto by Myriam Jessier on UnsplashI used to be a Data Analyst. Therefore, I knew about the importance of experiments and AB tests. It was always clear to me that qualitative hypotheses need to be validated by experiments. Research and developing user intuition are one side of the coin, but without validation against real user behavior, the coin doesn’t show the whole picture. I didn’t know you could do so many small experiments in a day, especially when you’re in the early stages of development. When you have a more mature product, it can get more complex, I can understand that, but I think a lot of people miss small opportunities to test and experiment. For example, we didn’t know what exactly our USP was and which USP appealed most to the users. To test this, we put signs in the elevator of the co-working office with a link that prompted a specific action. We changed those signs periodically with different wording to see what resonated well. I learned that even if you don’t reach the volume of users to get statistically reliable results, you can still learn a lot. In our case, it was more about collecting lots of different small data points that are not meaningful on their own, but in the context of a series of small experiments, they build up a picture.The starting point is not always a problemPhoto by Towfiqu barbhuiya on UnsplashHonestly, this was the most difficult thing for me to learn. Because of my previous analytical experience and all the wisdom of so many successful people, the “problem — hypothesis — solution” schema was hard-wired into my brain. I read everywhere that you have to make sure you identify a relevant problem worth solving in order to build a great product. And of course, that’s still true. But sometimes the problem is just not that obvious or the starting point. In our case, we had a technology and had to go backwards to see where it could be used. We created an experience and tested it with users to see where it resonated with them and why. So we had a solution, a technology, and tried to find the problem it solved. It took me some time to get used to that approach. I think, especially with very innovative technologies, the problem they solve is not always so obvious, and you may have to develop the technology and test it with users to figure out what abstract problem it can be used for. I have to admit that this can easily lead to developing a product that is not really relevant to its users but I still think it’s a valid approach. It could be similar with virtual reality / metaverse — it’s hard to imagine how this could be helpful in someone’s life, but once you experience a good use case, you’ll realize the benefit.Finding the sweet spot to give your team autonomy and ensure focus is hardPhoto by Cherrydeck on UnsplashGood product teams are autonomous teams. And even within the team, the individual roles should have a high degree of decision-making freedom. I definitely find it useful to motivate people, get them excited about a vision, and show them how much they contribute — and let them contribute. That’s why I’ve always tried to let the engineers make the technical decisions and the designers make the UX/design decisions. As PM, I need to see the big picture and make sure we’re moving in the right direction overall. And that’s the fine line that needs to be walked: When is the right time to step in, how do you make sure you don’t lose focus and steer the team in the right direction without compromising the freedom of others. Sometimes you just have to do it. And that happens more often than I thought. The key for me is good communication and team harmony. I have found it useful to be very close to the team, especially in the early days when the team (not just PM and UX) needs to develop a feel for the product and the users.The experience at DPS has taught me a lot about what it takes to build great products. There is a lot to learn and you will never stop learning. With the right mindset and even with little experience, I’m convinced that you just have to start this journey if you are interested in building products since there is a ton to learn along the way. If you’d like to connect and share thoughts on building great products, I’d love to hear from you on LinkedIn.Product ManagementProduct DevelopmentUX ResearchLeadershipSoftware Development----More from Christoph EmmertFollowLove podcasts or audiobooks?

That is what draws your attention but you are not quite sure which specific path you should take. There are obviously a lot of them as you see each time you browse through social media.The good news is that you are not alone. Your feelings are not strange. And the more exciting part is that it does not defy solutions.Tech and digital transformation are going on everywhere around us. Companies need designers to flesh out product ideas, marketers who can literally rub products on customers’ faces, developers, cyber security experts, and a lot more. And there is you. You who want to jump ship.The point of this piece is to save new entrants into the “tech” space some stress. The stress of having to exhaustively push around before they finally settle for something and begin the life-long journey of perfecting their choice.This is not to say you have to stick with the choice you make today — or later — “till death do you part.” On the contrary, many paths intertwine and people make switches from time to as occasion demands. Or as career growth demands. That’s the fun part of the entire thing.I won’t bother going into all the tech paths that there are in this piece. There is no room for them yet as they would probably require volumes of publication. I would simply touch on a few quite common and in-demand ones. Ones with…well…not so sharp learning curves. Don’t get me wrong. You have to put in the work and a lot of it for that matter. But if you’re coming from certain backgrounds, you could catch up with some of them faster.By the time you finish reading this, I expect you would be able to better define what path you would take.Product ManagementIf you’re coming from a management background, this might be something you consider. Just a little bit of thought. Relax. Don’t worry. Calm your nerves. Breathe in and out freely. It’s a no-code role. We haven’t got to that area yet.I like to call the Product Manager (PM) everybody’s dad — or mum. In the lifecycle of a digital product, this person is basically the product owner. They interact with everybody working on the product from the designers, marketers, developers, data analysts…and clients too. Everybody.The PM’s job starts from product ideation. They have to work with the UX designer — and data analyst — (we’ll come to these in a bit) to plan the product, interaction with interview respondents, creating user stories, and product release strategy.The PM is responsible for defining the requirement of the product and determining which features of the product are to be released and when depending on available data. They monitor research about the market and competitors.As stated earlier, they work with developers too to make sure tasks are promptly delivered and to standard. Essentially, the PM is the first point of contact with regard to anything related to the product they have at hand.Product/UI/UX DesignIn the actual scheme of things, the product designer, UI designer, and UX designer should be completely different guys taking up distinct roles. But I’m going to lump them all up as one in this piece. There is a reason for that. For one, I bet you always see the term “UI/UX” so written all the time. Right. Let’s keep it that way for now.This is also a no-code path. So, in case you’re so scared that everything in tech might require you to learn how to write code, this is another piece of evidence to the contrary.User Experience (UX) design is a track that works to ensure the smooth flow of web and mobile applications, software, and any product for that matter. The UX designer studies the user and designs products in tandem with their habits, motivation, and other factors, so the user can ultimately enjoy using the product while they seamlessly carry out tasks.How easy is this product to use? How can we make it better? In what ways can we improve the experience of the user while using this product? How smooth is the overall flow? These are some of the questions UX designers find themselves confronted with and strive to solve daily.The User Interface (UI) design, on the other, is where man and machine finally meet. It deals with the look and feel of a digital product’s interface. How elements in the product are eventually laid out.The UI designer creates the visual effect of the product. The data for this gotten from the UX designer’s work and what they flesh out directly subsists from what comes out of the UX research.This is the part of the product lifecycle where you begin to see beautiful images, colors, fancy buttons, and CTAs. The product literally starts breathing at this stage. Note that the UI designer is not a graphics designer. No. Please eliminate that thought. Quick.The reason you find the UI and UX written together is that both roles are usually played by the same person, except in large companies that are able to break every unit down. Think Google or Twitter.Lest I forget…UI/UX designers are colloquially called Product designers. Let’s not unpack the whole story here. Let’s take it as is for now.Web DevelopmentIt gets thicker here as the design, which is the result of the hard work of the UI/UX designer in conjunction with the PM, gets a new form of life with code. As you would know, a fantastic and aesthetically looking web/app design as it is has no real use to anybody. It has to come to life, and become interactive and usable. That’s where the developer come in.Oh, there are many forms of web and app development, as well as many languages which the scope of this piece will not cover. I want to limit it to web development for certain reasons.Moving on, there are two phases of web development. The front-end and the back-end. No doubt you might have heard of this dichotomy but wonder what exactly they mean. Well, that’s why you’re reading this.Front-end web development is the client side of the website or application. You’re reading this piece and interacting with this site currently on the front-end. It is the part you see and engage. The back-end, on the other hand, is the part you don’t see. You clicked on a link and it brought you to the website where you’re reading this, you exactly don’t know what happened behind the scene to land you here. That’s the business of the back-end guys.Furthermore, there are those who are specialized in both front-end and back-end web development, they are called full-stack developers. This is not to say that the full-stack developer is more valuable that front-end or back-end specialists. Not at all. So, no pressure.There is yet an interesting part to web development for those who might be scared of writing code. A number of no-code web development tools are now available and they work just fine. You just have to know how to design websites and you’re good to go. So, think Webflow, Wix, and Bubble, for example.Software DevelopmentDon’t mistake this for web development as many uninitiated folks would do. In case you are one of them, this is where you stop. Congratulations!As you know that web development is the technique of making existing web designs active, Software development is the technique of creating computer programs. Succinctly.There are, thus, three types of computer software. These are system software, application software, and utility software.A system software developer builds operating systems on which hardware is run. Think your Android, iOS, Windows, and the like. The application software developer builds applications that run on operating systems like your web browser, or design tool. Utility software are built to perform a certain task on your computers. Think of your anti-virus software.Data AnalysisData is the lifeblood of modern economies and every form of technology. Once products are released into the market, companies want to know the feedback with regard to user receptibility, behavior, and trend among other things. This will inform future product updates and business strategies that would further enhance the position of that product in the market.The data analyst collects data on product users, and analyzes them, so the product team can come up with actionable plans. This will guide the product owners to make better business decisions.They typically set up the systems they use to collect data. They are also responsible for cleaning up acquired data. They have specific tools used to analyze various data.Cyber SecurityCyber security experts help firms to build security and defense systems that protect their devices and sensitive data from malicious attacks, damages, security breaches, and other unauthorized incursions. Statistics have that this field will see a rapid increase and a lot of demand in years to come as companies are investing more in data protection.Wrap UpThere you go. Six tech career options that I think anyone would be able to latch on to and get moving within about a year. If you are still not sure of what your gut might be saying, of course, do further research, but ultimately, take that leap!Importantly, don’t forget what I stated earlier that you are not tied to one thing.

This means you will have to develop certain skills to make sure you stay on top of your game. Among these are maintaining a project management certification and maintaining empathy.Empathy is an underrated skill for a project managerIf you’re looking for a way to stand out from the crowd, you might want to consider adding empathy to your toolbox. A little bit of this pixie dust can go a long way, especially when it comes to your job.Empathy is the art of understanding your team members’ motives, which can make your job a lot easier. By taking the time to understand your team members’ needs, you can match them to the right work assignments, which can lead to high level performance.One of the most underrated skills in the modern day workforce is listening. Most leaders have a reputation for being terrible listeners. However, learning how to best utilize your ears can improve your leadership game.Using the appropriate tone of voice will tell you a lot about a person’s true emotions. This can be important when a team member is feeling down and out. Taking the time to listen to their complaints and concerns can go a long way towards improving your work life balance.Keep your team motivatedIf you’re a project manager, you know how important it is to keep your team motivated. After all, a good team is what most companies use to get the big stuff done. So, how do you do it?One of the best ways to keep your team motivated is to give them feedback. Not only will you show your appreciation, you’ll also improve their performance. And it’s an easy thing to do.The best way to do that is to provide monthly performance sheets. Having a performance sheet will allow you to track the progress of your team and make sure they’re meeting their goals.Also, you can encourage your team to come up with ideas for new projects. This will give them the opportunity to see the bigger picture and learn about your company’s purpose. You’ll find that when everyone is working toward a common goal, the work gets done and the quality goes up.Maintain a project management certificationA project management certification can be a valuable tool to advance your career. These certifications add credibility to your skills, give you better career opportunities, and boost your income. But it can be confusing to choose the right one for you.Whether you are new to the industry or a seasoned professional, there are dozens of different options available to you. However, there are some general guidelines to follow when selecting a project management certification.Project management is a challenging career. You must have the knowledge and ability to manage a team, set and meet project objectives, and deal with conflict of interests. It also requires leadership and good communication skills.There are many project management certifications available, and they are designed to cover a range of job functions. Some focus on demonstrating overall project management skills, while others are more specific to certain methodologies.The Project Management Professional (PMP) is the most commonly recognized certification for project managers.

Stay tuned!1. What is a funnel and why it’s important for conversion rate optimization?We have a more general definition of a funnel at SessionStack.A funnel is a set of ordered expected steps that, in the best-case scenario, your user will follow from beginning to end to achieve a business milestone (conversion). In the SessionStack platform steps in a funnel can be end-user actions (mouse clicks, keyboard interactions, scroll, touch events) or end-user navigations to defined locations (URLs), or a combination of both. All of these events, whether user actions or navigations occur sequentially, and each step that we want to measure is defined in our funnel accordingly.It is unavoidable that not all of our users will follow this flow from start to finish. To achieve product growth, we must investigate user behaviors and optimize the deviation from the desired action. This is best done with funnel analysis, as funnels are the best tool to visualize user flows and analyze the conversion rate of each step. Especially combined with session replay, where you can literally see and understand the user actions of funnel converters or dop-offs.However, traditional analytics funnels require instrumentation, where you can only measure a static predefined set of steps you qualify as the best customer journey. This causes a significant analytical handicap especially in more complex digital products, with the constant development of new features.Here is where SessionStack Funnels are truly useful. Since our platform relies on the auto-capture of data it can provide instrumentation-free funnels that are easy to set up and work retroactively. So can have your conversion analysis right away, starting from any point of the user journey, unfolding every hidden step in between.You can easily analyze and optimize the conversion process from any login and onboarding, through complex feature adoption, or subscription. From any product page view through the shopping cart steps, till purchase.In brief, the instrumentation-free Funnels of SessionStack are providing us with the ability to:Visualize any desired flow that we want our users to go through without the need for initial preparation;Track how many of our users complete each step and how many drop out;Investigate the causes of drop-offs and understand better the behavior of converters by replaying the sessions of both segments and following their trendsBased on the findings, we can fix the identified issues and then verify our conversion optimization effort by comparing the results of both segments before and afterBased on the findings, we can fix the identified issues and then verify our conversion optimization effort by comparing the results of both segments before and after.2. Definition of funnel event steps “In this order”A funnel visualization is a series of an ordered set of events, which means that the event described in step one occurs before the event described in step two. However other events from the user journey may occur in between. In SessionStack the Funnel configuration setting “In this order” follows precisely this example and it’s used to describe only the mandatory steps in a journey in order to achieve the desired business goal (conversion).To get a better picture of the setting “In this order”, consider the following scenario.A customer is looking for green handbags on an e-commerce website. They are adding a handbag to the cart and then proceed to the checkout page. The first step is to visit a product page, then add an item to the cart, and the third is to navigate to the checkout page. However, before proceeding to the payment, the user may examine several sets of shoes and belts. Using the setting “in this order” we’ll conduct a funnel analysis specifically of the described process. If we see a significant decrease from step one to steps two and three, we can isolate drop-offs, replay their sessions and optimize our purchase flow, so we keep users focused on finishing the order.SessionStack Funnel Chart3. Visualizing funnel steps across all sessions or within one user sessionSo far, we’ve discussed what the sequential order of events in a funnel means. Now let’s review the definition of session order type in SessionStack Funnels. There are two options we support:“Across all sessions”: will search for a set of funnel steps that occur across all sessions of a userConsider the following scenario. There is a new user to the e-commerce site. They navigate to the desired product (the first step of the funnel) during their first session and in the fourth session, they decide to finalize their purchase (the last step of the funnel). Both events, Visting that particular URL and pressing the button “Purchase“ are part of the funnel configuration. Once the funnel is built, the search for events will be performed for all users across all of their sessions, and our newbie will be listed in this funnel.“Within the Same Session“: will search for a set of funnel steps that are completed in one user sessionIn the preceding example, if we select the “Within the same session” option, our newbie in the e-commerce site will not be listed as converted because all steps were not completed in the same session.4. How to configure a Conversion Funnel in SessionStack?The Funnels dashboard is in the main menu on the left side. There is a new icon as shown below:SessionStack Funnel DashboardOnce you are there, press the “New Funnel” button and you will go to the funnel creation page where you can configure your steps. The general funnel settings and visualization is shown when you add at least two steps. There is a default selection of general settings for your convenience.The default selection for Session order type is: “Within the same session”.Selected users are: “All users“. Soon we’ll include the ability to select and compare previously saved segments from our primary dashboard (Segments).Session Type: “Across All Sessions” & “Within the Same Session”As we mentioned above, one of the advantages of SessionStack DXI is that it’s an instrumentation-free platform. You don’t need to predefine events, as it’s widespread with traditional analytical tools. All you have to do is select events from the Search filter list. We currently offer the four events listed below, but we are constantly adding new filters:Visited URLClicked Element with contextual filter: Visited URLRage Click with contextual filter: Visited URLDead Click with contextual filter: Visited URLEach chosen event is a separate step of a funnel. When at least two steps are added, a funnel chart will be visualized. Each new step will be reflected in the funnel chart automatically.SessionStack Funnel Configuration5. Wondering which option to use: “Within the same session“ OR “Across all sessions“?The funnel setup covering a user experience “Across all sessions” is better suited to analyzing long-term processes in SaaS products. Usually, it takes much more than one session for a user to be onboarded to a complex product. Adoption of all its features takes even longer. In this case, searching for events across all sessions of a user helps us fully visualize their journey and conduct a meaningful conversion analysis.While funnel event search “Within the same session” is better suited to analyzing a short-term conversion process, for example in e-commerce sites, aiming for impulsive purchases. In such cases, the business goal is to turn a potential customer into a paying one right away.At SessionStack we use both options. It helps us draw better conclusions about how to better help our users both short and long-term.6. Funnel chart summaryCurrently, we provide general information about converted users (who have completed a specific step) and drop-off users (who have abandoned a specific step). All of these figures can be examined for each step by hovering the mouse over each bar. The dark blue bar represents successfully passed step users, while the light blue portion of the bar represents dropped-off users.Funnel Summary for Converted UsersFunnel Summary for the Drop-off Users7. Coming soon: a detailed funnel conversion summary. Stay tuned!A more detailed summary with lists of converted and dropped-off users and their relevant sessions will be presented soon. Thus allowing you to further investigate the causes of drop-offs or conversions, watch relevant sessions of both user groups and discover conversion opportunities in your funnel.SessionStack instrumentation-free Funnels significantly enhance our feature set of product management solutions. In our roadmap, we plan to continue their upgrade in order to provide even better capabilities for funnel analysis.Interested in SessionStack?

SzczurekFollowDec 20·10 min readSaveMarket ResearchMarket research is the process of gathering, analyzing, and interpreting information about a market, product, or service. It is typically used to identify potential customers, understand their needs and preferences, and determine the best way to market a product or service. Many methods and techniques are used in market research, including surveys, focus groups, and market analysis. Market research aims to provide businesses with the information they need to make informed decisions about their products, services, and overall strategy.Market Research coverThere are many different areas of market research, and the specific areas that are covered can vary depending on the business's needs and the research goals. However, some common areas of market research include:Market size and growth: This type of research involves analyzing the size and growth of a market in terms of both the total number of potential customers and the amount of money they are willing to spend. This can help businesses determine whether there is enough demand for their product or service to be profitable.Customer demographics and behavior: This type of research focuses on understanding the characteristics of potential customers, such as their age, gender, income, and education level. It also looks at their behavior, such as how they make purchasing decisions and what factors influence their choices.Competitor analysis: This research involves studying competitors' products, services, and marketing strategies in the same market. This can help businesses identify areas where they have a competitive advantage and areas they may need to improve to stay competitive.Market dynamics analysis: market research that focuses on understanding the factors influencing the supply and demand of a product or service in a particular market. This can include factors such as the economic environment, consumer behavior, competition, and government regulations. By understanding these factors, businesses can make more informed decisions about their products, services, and overall strategy.Product and pricing: This research focuses on understanding customer needs and preferences regarding products and pricing. It can help businesses determine the best way to position their products in the market and what prices customers are willing to pay.While a thorough market research approach includes the above areas, sometimes all you need at the moment is to focus on a specific area.Market sizingSeveral approaches can be used to size a market. Here are a few common ones:Top-down approach:This involves starting with the market's total size and then breaking it down into smaller segments to estimate the size of each segment. For example, suppose you want to size the market for a particular product. In that case, start by estimating the total size of the market for all products in that category and then adjust your estimate based on the market share of your product.A common method for estimating the size of a market from the top down is the Total Addressable Market (TAM), Substantial Addressable Market (SAM), and Served Available Market (SOM) framework. This framework involves analyzing the total potential demand for a product or service, the portion of that demand that a company can realistically target, and the share of that targeted demand that the company can actually capture through its current offerings and distribution channels.Bottom-up approachThis involves starting with the size of the individual segments of the market and then aggregating them to estimate the market's total size. For example, suppose you want to size the market for a particular product. In that case, start by estimating the market size for each customer segment or geographic region and then summing those estimates to get the total market size.The comparative approachinvolves comparing the market you are trying to size to a similar market that has already been sized. For example, suppose you want to size the market for a particular product in a new geographic region. In that case, you might compare it to the market for a similar product in a region that has already been sized.Expert judgment approachThis involves soliciting the opinions of experts in the field to estimate the size of the market. This approach can be helpful when limited data is available or when the market is highly specialized.It’s important to note that no single approach is perfect, and you may need to use a combination of these approaches to get a reliable market size estimate.Benefits of conducting market sizing from a client perspective:It helps companies understand the potential of their products or services: By understanding the size of the market their products or services target, companies can better understand the potential for revenue and growth.It helps companies allocate resources effectively: By understanding the size and characteristics of the target market, companies can allocate resources more efficiently and effectively, such as by focusing marketing efforts on the most promising segments of the market.It helps companies identify opportunities and threats: Market sizing can help companies identify opportunities for growth and potential threats from competitors, allowing them to develop strategies to take advantage of opportunities and mitigate risks.It helps companies benchmark their performance: By understanding the market's size and market share, companies can benchmark their performance against competitors and identify areas for improvement.It helps companies develop realistic financial projections: By understanding the size and characteristics of the target market, companies can develop more accurate financial projections and set realistic goals for growth.Market sizing can help companies understand the potential of their products or services and make informed decisions about resource allocation and strategic planning.Market dynamics analysisMarket dynamics analysis involves studying the various factors that influence the demand and supply of a product or service in a market and the relationships and interactions between these factors. This can include economic, technological, social, and political factors, as well as the behavior and decision-making of consumers and businesses. By analyzing market dynamics, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of the forces at play in the market and how they are likely to impact demand and supply.How to do market dynamics analysisThere are several key factors to consider when analyzing the market dynamics for a tech product. These include:Switching cost: How difficult is it for users to switch to a new solution? For example, if you are developing a new messaging app, the switching cost may be high, as users would have to leave behind existing contact groups.Buying power: What kind of expenses can your target market afford? While corporate buyers can afford higher costs, small companies may be more cost-conscious. Depending on the market's location, such as the US versus Ghana, may also be differences in buying power.Market competition: How saturated is the market? Is it a highly competitive “red ocean” market or a less crowded “blue ocean” market?Market growth: Is the market growing or declining? What are the projections for the near future compared to other markets?Technology dependencies: Is your solution dependent on other technologies? If so, how does this impact your potential market? For example, a virtual reality product may have higher barriers to entry due to the high equipment cost.Regulatory factors: What is the regulatory landscape of your industry? For example, if you are developing a fintech or health tech product, you may need to adhere to strict regulatory criteria and keep up with any changes in requirements.You can search online SEO and trend tools to gather information on these factors, check your potential competitors, and read research studies. Understanding these factors early on is essential to avoid any unexpected challenges.Market dynamics analysis benefits from a client perspectiveSome of the main benefits include:Improved decision-making: By understanding the factors that influence the supply and demand of a product or service, clients can make more informed decisions about their own products and services. For example, they can determine the best prices, the most effective marketing strategies, and the most promising target markets to focus on.Better positioning: By understanding the competitive landscape and the factors likely to impact the market, clients can position their products and services to maximize their chances of success. This can help them differentiate their offerings from competitors and gain a competitive advantage.Increased profitability: By making better decisions and positioning their products and services more effectively, clients can increase their profitability and generate more revenue.Market dynamics analysis can provide valuable insights and help clients make more informed decisions about their products, services, and overall strategy. This can ultimately lead to increased profitability and success in the market.Competition AnalysisCompetitive analysis is the process of studying your competitors' strengths and weaknesses to better understand the market and position your product or company more effectively.As a product designer, understanding your competitors is crucial for a number of reasons:It helps you identify opportunities and threats in the market: By analyzing your competitors, you can identify areas where they are weak or lacking and create a product that addresses those needs. You can also identify trends or shifts in the market and use that information to your advantage.It helps you understand the market: By studying your competitors, you can better understand the market demand and how your product fits into the larger market. You can also learn about the preferences and needs of your target audience.It helps you create a unique value proposition: By understanding your competitors, you can differentiate your product and create a unique value proposition that sets it apart from the competition.To conduct a competitive analysis, you can start by identifying your main competitors and analyzing their products, pricing, distribution channels, marketing strategies, and target audience. You can also gather data on their financial performance, customer feedback, and market share.Once you have gathered this information, you can use it to inform your product development and marketing strategies. For example, you might focus on a specific niche within the market or create a product that offers unique features or benefits not offered by your competitors.Several battle-tested approaches can be used to conduct a competition analysis:Feature Gap AnalysisProcess of comparing the features of a product or service with those of its competitors to identify areas where the product is lacking or where there is an opportunity to differentiate the product from the competition.There are several steps involved in conducting a feature gap analysis:Identify competitors: The first step is to identify the main competitors in the market and gather information on their products and features.Identify key features: Next, identify the key features that are important to customers in the market and how competitors are currently offering those features.Analyze gaps: Compare the features of your product to those of the competition and identify any gaps or areas where the competition is stronger.Determine priorities: Based on the gap analysis, determine which features are most important to customers and prioritize the development of those features.Develop a plan: Based on the priorities identified in the gap analysis, develop a plan to address any gaps or weaknesses in the product’s features and differentiate the product from the competition.Feature gap analysis can be a useful tool for product development and marketing strategies, helping companies identify opportunities to improve their products and differentiate themselves in the market.Competitive AdvantageCompetitive advantage refers to a company's unique advantage over its competitors in the market. The factors allow a company to produce goods or services more efficiently or effectively than its competitors or offer unique or superior products or services.There are several ways that a company can achieve a competitive advantage:Cost advantage: This involves producing goods or services at a lower cost than competitors, allowing the company to offer lower prices or higher profit margins.Differentiation: This involves offering unique or superior products or services that are not easily replicated by competitors, such as through proprietary technology or high-quality materials.Niche focus: This involves specializing in a specific market segment or targeting a specific customer group, allowing the company to meet the needs of that market better and gain a competitive advantage.Strong brand: A strong brand can differentiate a company from its competitors and create a competitive advantage by establishing a loyal customer base and building customer trust and confidence.Overall, competitive advantage is essential for companies because it can help them differentiate their products or services, capture a larger market share, and achieve sustainable competitive advantage.Competition Analysis benefits from clients' perspectiveThere are several benefits to conducting a competition analysis from a client perspective:It helps companies understand the competitive landscape: By analyzing key competitors' strategies and market share, companies can better understand their industry's competitive dynamics and identify opportunities and threats.It helps companies identify areas for improvement: By comparing their products or services to those of their competitors, companies can identify areas where they are lacking and prioritize improvements to their offerings.It helps companies develop strategies to differentiate their products: By understanding the unique value proposition of their competitors, companies can develop strategies to differentiate their products and create a unique selling proposition in the market.It helps companies benchmark their performance: By analyzing the performance of their competitors, companies can benchmark their own performance and identify areas for improvement.SummaryWhen considering a new business idea, assessing whether the market conditions are favorable for your company is essential. Some key questions to consider include the following:Are the market dynamics advantageous for your company? This involves analyzing the factors driving or inhibiting market demand and determining whether your company is well-positioned to take advantage of those dynamics.Is the market big enough? This involves estimating the market size and determining whether it is large enough to support your business.Can you provide a strong enough competitive advantage to capture a significant market share? This involves analyzing the competitive landscape and determining whether your company has a unique advantage or proposition that can differentiate it from the competition.By answering these questions, you can better understand the potential of your new business venture and make informed decisions about whether to pursue it.Market ResearchProduct ManagementResearchUXProduct Design----More from UX PlanetFollowUX Planet is a one-stop resource for everything related to user experience.Read more from UX PlanetRecommended from MediumErik MessakiinOutcrowdWhat Makes a Brand Successful?Dindayal GuptaWindow Blinds and Shades GalleryKim ChunginUX SchoolWe need more Calm DesignHyesoo SchinnShopwell Design ChallengeThomas A.

For example, here is what a typical week of my life looks like as a product manager at Octopus Deploy:A snapshot of what a typical week looks like for me at Octopus DeployHaving your calendar booked out can happen for the following reasons:Communication funnel: Part of a product manager’s responsibilities is to be a two way communication funnel, in that we are not only communicating what our team is working on with the rest of the company and with our customers, but that we are also communicating back with our team what the rest of the company and our customers have to say, in terms of feedback, ideas or problems to be solved. As such, it is quite likely that your day will involve lots of different calls, chats and meetings with a variety of individuals that both represent the company internally or the customer externally to help align them with what your team is working on and how that contributes or benefits the rest of the company in the short and long term.Product-level discussions: As a product manager, you will be involved in discussions with both engineering and design on ways forward when delivering a new feature for the customer or a solution for a long standing customer issue. This usually takes place in the form of a brainstorming session, where high-level concepts, ingenious ideas or light-handed solutions are considered together as part of a collaboration between engineering, design and product. As such, you’ll find your calendar booked out by a number of different sessions with different members of your team throughout your week as you try to get work out of the door or to ship a new feature or fix by the end of your sprint.Personal discovery and analysis: Finally, if and when you find yourself with some free air with no meetings or calls scheduled, that time is usually spent with completing some of the discovery and analytics work that is expected of a product manager — i.e. extracting insights from recorded customer calls, analysing the quantitative data on your analytics dashboard, writing up research documents and GTM plans etc. These items require time set aside to completely focus and ‘get in the zone’, if you will, in order to complete them up to the standard expected of a product manager.As can be seen above, this is an extensive list of items that usually need to be completed either fully or partially in some form by the end of the week. On the flip side, your time is finite and there is only so many things a product manager can complete in a day or week before they feel completely burned out by the number of things that need to be done. This article will help provide some tips and tricks in not only how you can prioritise what needs to be done first but also how you can organise your day, as a product manager, as to get the most value out of the tasks that you need to complete moving forward.List down your weekly rituals and mark them off by the end of the dayPhoto by Kasturi Roy on UnsplashTo determine what you need to complete during the day, split your tasks into the following:Daily rituals: These are the tasks that must be completed by the end of the day or week. They are the non-negotiables and form part of the crucial list of tasks expected of a product manager. Examples of what your daily rituals are include discovery work (e.g. listening to recordings of customer conversations or analysing your analytics dashboard), backlog grooming, sprint planning etc.Optional extras: These are tasks that do not have a hard deadline or are necessarily required to be completed within a certain amount of time. They are usually flexible in terms of scope and timing, and can be done whenever you find yourself with some free air. Examples of what your optional extras are include updating document templates, giving an educational presentation to other parts of the organisation etc.As a product manager, it is important that you are able to discern which of your tasks need to be done — your daily rituals — vs which of your regular tasks should actually be de-prioritised and form part of the background or fallback of other items and tasks that you can complete if your daily rituals have all been completed.Once you’ve determined which tasks fall into which bucket, come up with a simple task planner that you can use to keep yourself aligned and on track to completing your rituals by the end of the day or week. For example, the task planner can look something like this:The task planner I use to keep track of my daily ritualsAlthough it looks and sounds basic, you will be surprised by how easily this can help motivate and align you with ticking off all of the regular and important tasks you need to do as a product manager. There is a certain sense of satisfaction in ticking off each checkbox as you complete them for the day or week, which can help ensure that you are not only performing your tasks but that you are also completing all the tasks that are important to your function as a product manager.Confine and complete tasks using the Pomodoro methodPhoto by Marcelo Leal on UnsplashCompleting your tasks on time is like slaying dragons — if not planned in advanced, you’ll probably find yourself underequipped and melted by the burning hot fire of one task piled up on top of another before you even have time to scream for any help whatsoever.Inept — actually, probably more bad — analogy aside, it is true that your tasks as a product manager have a way of not only taking longer than expected to complete but also multiply out of control to the point where you find yourself with an ever increasing task list, each with an increasing amount of difficulty with little to no end in sight.A simple way in which you can ensure you complete your tasks in time and keep your to-do’s in check is to follow the tried and tested Pomodoro method, along with a way of visually ticking off your tasks once you’re done, such as in the following example:My Pomodoro To-Do ListThe following are the steps you should take in conjunction with the above to-do listPick a task: This can include one of your daily rituals, optional extras or other important tasks that might fall onto your lap throughout the course of the day or week. The important thing is to just pick 1 task first, so that you are not only ensuring you are focused on what needs to get done but that you are also actually getting things done, which helps you to build momentum as you continue to pick up other tasks after the first task is completed.Set a 25-minute timer: Using either the timer app on your phone or a kitchen timer, set it up for 25 minutes, which is the optimal time to stay 100% focused. Start your timer and work on your chosen task without any form of distraction or side quests to the fridge you might be tempted to take during this time. Don’t stop focusing and completing your task until the timer goes off.Take a 5-minute break: Once the timer rings, stop your task and take a quick break. This can take the form of a 5-minute meditation or some light reading. Avoid other forms of heavy attention stealing activities, such as using social media. Give your brain and mind a rest from the intense 25 minutes of work you’ve just completed and restore your energy.Repeat until you complete 4 consecutive tasks: Repeat steps 1–3 above until you’ve completed 4 tasks in succession, with the appropriate 5 minute breaks in between. Once this is done, give yourself a longer 30-minute break before repeating the whole process again.Using this method, not only are you able to provide your sole attention to the task at hand, but that you are also able to complete several tasks within an hour that can help you get things off of your to-do list and make progress towards completing both your important and optional tasks for the day or week.Timebox meetings and schedule them in only when necessaryPhoto by krakenimages on UnsplashFinally, a large proportion of the advice above when it comes to organising, scheduling and completing tasks can also be applied to scheduling and completing meetings on time. When it comes to meetings, be sure to categorise what is an important meeting (i.e. one-on-one’s with your head of product, daily standups with your team or discussions with other product managers on initiatives) and what can be relegated into the background of being optional and non-intrusive on your day to day tasks.Once you are able to categorise which meetings should be attended and which is optional for you, ensure that you are not only setting the agenda for said meeting but that you are also limiting the amount of time each meeting starts and ends. I recommend that each meeting should go no longer than 15–30 minutes to provide you the most optimum time to focus on the topic that’s being discussed and to respect the time of the other participants in the meeting.To read more about how to manage and schedule your meetings, please feel free to read my previous article here.ConclusionFollow the tips above and you’ll be organising your day like a product manager in no time.

Product managers work with various teams, including engineering, design, sales, marketing, and customer support. They must communicate effectively with all these teams and coordinate their efforts to deliver successful products. But what are the rules of the land to be morally eligible for these long and hard PM interviews (the only way to reduce the risk is practice). Let’s look at the 10 must-have skills:Photo by Christina @ wocintechchat.com on Unsplash1. Understanding of agile development methodologiesAgile is a popular approach to managing and delivering software projects, and a product manager should have a strong understanding of how it works and how to apply it effectively.2. Familiarity with design thinkingDesign thinking is a process for creatively and systematically solving complex problems. As a product manager, understanding this process can help you develop innovative products that meet your customers' needs.3. Knowledge of user experience (UX) design principlesA product manager should have a good understanding of UX design principles to create products that are easy to use and engaging for users.4. Understanding of data analysis and metricsProduct managers should be able to use data to inform their decision-making and track the performance of their products.5. Familiarity with codingWhile a product manager doesn't need to be a software engineer, familiarity with coding can help understand how technical decisions impact the product.6. Knowledge of project management toolsProduct managers often use tools like JIRA and Trello to manage their projects and teams. Familiarity with these and other project management tools can help you stay organized and on track.7. Understanding of financial analysisA product manager should be able to analyze financial data to make informed decisions about the direction of the product and the allocation of resources.8. Knowledge of marketing principlesProduct managers should have a basic understanding of marketing principles to promote and sell their products effectively.9. Familiarity with customer relationship management (CRM) systemsUnderstanding CRM systems can help a product manager track customer interactions and build strong customer relationships.10. Understanding of legal and compliance issuesA product manager should be aware of any legal or compliance issues that may impact the product and should be able to work with legal and compliance teams to ensure that the product is compliant.If you have reached this far, good luck with your applications.

This team manages the experience powered by GraphQL that enables Pluralsight customers to access the API.I was granted this opportunity for 3 months as part of my learning and career development in the area of Product Management.My goal in working with this team was to assess the unknowns, identify the biggest areas of opportunity, and deliver high value to the customer. Much like Beast from X-men, APIs are complex and interesting. I fell in love with the beast, and maybe you will too after reading this article.The Problem BriefThe developer.plurarlsight.com site was supposed to be self-service, however in its previous state, the page was proving to be difficult to navigate and could take users that aren’t familiar with GraphQL a while to get up and running.Additionally, there was a visual disconnect between the static (getting started) pages and the dynamic (schema) pages.There was no tracking or analytics on the developer API site to identify current customer journeys through the pages. This was based on the number of times an API was accessed, not necessarily the use of the developer portal. It was also difficult to identify how much time someone was spending on the site.Identifying the CustomerMy biggest challenge was defining who the customer was of the API. When I came into the team, the director had an idea of who the customers were based on past experience. But very little research had been done recently to validate that these personas were still up to snuff.I quietly observed the team that was building out the APIs for the existing portal. The developers within the team used the portal themselves and other internal staff leveraged the platform.This led to some bias around what the team thought they should be building. I frequently asked the question, “Why are we building this?” I heard statements like, “We have our own pain points when using the documentation, so I think we have a good handle on what needs to be done,” or, “Based on Professional Services feedback we are going in this direction.”They had fallen into a trap and weren’t really sure why they were putting in time and energy into certain features. Don’t get me wrong, people in customer support and sales roles can be some of your greatest allies, but it’s all second hand anecdotal detail. It’s best to go straight to the source.Customer ResearchFirst I want to emphasize that customer research is not a linear exercise. It should be done regularly, and often. A job to be done that a customer has today could change tomorrow based on a variety of environmental factors and market trends.However, with my rotational project, the customer research phase happened much later in the process. This was beyond my control as an intern was assigned to the project prior to my joining the team. The software engineer on the project jumped right into coding without any findings to back up the proposed solution. It was all based on team agreements.I will also add that a product designer was not yet on the project, so design elements were rather rough. The UI for the API documentation and general navigation had not been evaluated since its launch in 2018.The landing page prior to customer researchNotice in the old navigation that the schema is at the top, and the quick start documentation is on the left navigation. The development team hypothesized that the schema could dynamically generate instead of having multiple lines of GraphQL to read through.A few opportunities identified were 1)Adding a search feature 2)Grouping the data in a more understandable way 3)Identifying if a mutation or query was accessible to a specific purchase optionCustomer InterviewsAPI documentation as a standard should be self service. If you type in “API for blank company” you’ll see what I’m talking about. So one of the outcomes we were hoping for was to make the site as user friendly as possible for any skill level with no personal guidance from a Pluralsight employee.Over the course of a few weeks, I paired with a designer to dig into some of the customer behaviors when using the API. We pursued interviewing customers within our own organization that had little to no experience with GraphQL and that did not use the the developer portal landing page. These were considered our “newbies”.I also pushed to talk to a couple of paying customers who actively engaged with the site. I had to get creative in finding these folks by parsing through customer tickets and talking to the technical support team. These were labeled “power users”.Watching the UserBefore an interview, you may have an assumption about a workflow that can be completely turned upside down simply by watching someone do their work. I love this part of the process.In my research with the API I wanted to understand the navigation behavior and the types of tasks each user was trying to accomplish. We worked off of a script that had questions such as “What are you seeing?” and “What are you expecting here?” “Explain to me where you are going and why?” But the most important question was the rating. We wanted to gauge the usability of the site and asked the users to rank the usability from 1–5 with 1 being the worst and 5 being dream land.It was interesting to see how a power user navigated the experience vs. someone who had never seen the interface before. One thing I learned from this exercise was that people create mental models for themselves and work around issues without really thinking about it. (The power user was actually more hesitant to adopt the simpler click path because they were so used to the old navigation!)We asked the participants to rank how frequently they accessed the page and to compare it to other developer portals they have leveraged. Next, we gave the user a task to run a moderately advanced query. We gave no guidance, and instead watched the behavior of the developer attempting to complete the task.What we discovered over the course of our research was the following:Developers are busy. They don’t want to have re-learn something that they only do every few months. They needed an example query pre-populated for them so they could quickly identify how to query the data for their specific organization.The order of the query/mutation was confusing. In fact, a lot of the walk through was confusing. So we added descriptions to the top of each schema doc.This is the new version of the Developer Portal. Notice the simplified navigation on the side.We moved the GraphQL for dummies explanation to a more prominent part of the page. We also added a search bar so the data could be more easily parsed.Instead of a large schema that had to be parsed for the specific filters, we broke the schema down by the data set and available data points. We added little chip identifiers so a developer would know which data could be queried vs. mutated.We added a mini playground with a pre-populated sample query. This is visible even without your API key. Pretty handy.Prior to release, we ran beta tests with some internal power users through professional services. We identified bugs and potential risks and then charged ahead!This was a very fulfilling project during my learning journey as a product manager. I got my feet wet with customer research, was able learn from a product designer, and successfully launched a feature set! The beast that is APIs isn’t a horror film type of scary. But really is like Beast from X-Men. Very powerful and smart when used correctly. ;)Api DevelopmentApi DocumentationGraph QLProduct ManagementProduct Design----1More from Stephanie JeromeFollowLove podcasts or audiobooks?

I joined the company a little over two years ago as part of an acquisition.There were three things that encouraged me to join Sinch after nine years of working in my previous company. Firstly, I really liked the people and what I could see of the company culture. During the acquisition process, every interaction that I had gave me the impression that Sinch employees are focused on collaborating and working hard to solve problems.The second thing was the opportunity to be part of a fast-growing technology company in an exciting market. Sinch’s sustained profitable growth and market reputation puts it in a great position to become the sector leader.Thirdly, I’m someone who embraces change and Sinch is a place where we’re always trying to improve and grow. It’s fantastic to be somewhere where constructive change comes so fast.A lot of people want to come to a fast-growing company like Sinch because of the opportunity to make an impact. This was much easier to do when the company was small but as we’ve grown, it’s become very important to align the organization and to have enough process in place to allow decisions to be taken at all levels of the organization without unnecessary bureaucracy. In support of continuing the collaboration and growth culture, across the company we are working to put processes in place to help people get things done quickly and accurately.As an example, through our acquisitions, we have a large product portfolio that can be used in many ways to solve customer problems. By defining and enforcing processes to identify and select the most efficient solution configurations to address specific use cases we can get customers up and running faster and reduce the time spent internally to make this happen.I’m sometimes asked what to expect when joining Sinch in a product role. In summary I’d say that for any profile, the opportunity for career growth is huge through customer driven innovation, working with diverse global teams and building to scale. We’re in the constantly evolving CPaaS space where customers want to engage more effectively with their lconsumers. Product teams get to work very closely with customers to learn what drives the return on investment and how best to satisfy these through feature delivery. Consumers worldwide behave and communicate differently and our experiencing this through our global reach brings real market intelligence to the product teams.For those product professionals who are interested in building for scale and organizational and process efficiency, as our volumes of customers and traffic grow, we invest in efficiency and automation to make all our lives easier. I’d also say that while you can find an area in which to focus, there are always product opportunities for new areas too. It’s a great place to work in product.Interested to learn more about Sinch and perhaps become a part of our team?

One of the challenges with being a generalist is acquiring breadth. As I wrap up my first year in the profession, I want to share what I learned and the tools I used in the process. There will be three posts in these series with this one being focused on working with a scrum team.Scrum is a unique way of working. Think of it as a group of individuals collectively working to solve complex problems by breaking them down into ever smaller pieces with the final deliverable for each being a codebase merge.I like to think of the complex problem (formalized by a product backlog) as a pyramid that is built up of small cubes. These small cubes are individual, self-contained pieces of work that eventually get pulled into sprints. From afar, however the product backlog looks like a monolithic object that underpins the product strategy.For the sake of argument, let’s assume that company strategy starts at the top. It is then broken up into smaller pieces which get allocated to departments. The product department sets the tone for where they think the product can support corporate strategy. This is a very broad concept. To turn this into actionable items, the product strategy is continuously refined into smaller pieces that developers can work on. Assuming the PM is the scrum master, product’s role on the scrum team, in large part, is to facilitate this refinement process.Consistency and trust are central to running a well-functioning scrum team.To that end, I gradually recognized how much documentation my team had prepared to deal with topics central to how they work.Team norms is a great place to start. Teams document things like scrum ceremonies, standup discussion items, meeting etiquette and responsibilities, as well as a number of things to do with how pull requests and code reviews are performed. You should make yourself familiar with all this content. It will help you greatly in your day-to-day interactions. Specifically, I would focus on the following documents:Definition of ready covers what is required for a ticket to be pulled into a refinement session where it will be pointed and then injected into a sprint. To ensure efficient use of everyone’s time and that a given ticket is well understood and is thus appropriately pointed, there needs to be a certain amount of detail and the ticket needs to be overall cohesively written.Definition of done defines what is required from the team to mark a given story or a spike as completed, ie. when a given ticket is moved to the ‘Done’ column of your board.Capacity planning is an important tool in scrum. Making sure you are able to predict how much work can be injected into a given sprint is crucial to the role of a good PM. Each team will have slightly different ways of tracking points and the sprint planning meeting may take on a different shape. Any documentation on this topic should be top of your reading list when starting off in the PM career.The list of team norms will slightly differ for each team. I encourage you to scour whatever documentation tool your team has. The last thing any PM or scrum master should do is introduce additional friction to the way the team works. Friction in this context refers to doing things that slow the team down. To that end, your aim is to hit the ground running!In agile, the scrum process is meant to be repetitive; that is partly where its power comes from. Depending on the team you’re on, a sprint will last anywhere from a week to a month. On my team it lasts two weeks. Two weeks go by fast. You are always either wrapping up a sprint, kicking one off, or doing some form of analysis on sprint performance. Staying proactive and not reactive should become your superpower.Writing effective tickets will have a major influence on the velocity your team is able to achieve. Oftentimes teams will document what it means to write an effective ticket. Below I’ve listed a few universal principles that will help with writing an effective ticket:Starting with a business value (BV) or jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) statement before moving to acceptance criteria (AC) ensures people reading the ticket get initial insight into what it’s meant to accomplish. This will often lead to additional ACs and test cases being added during refinement.Writing tickets that are descriptive vs. prescriptive. A good example of this is moving towards the phrasing “An API endpoint exists that ___” vs. “Create an API endpoint that ___”. In general it is essential to provide your team with problem statements instead of guiding them to a proposed solution.Writing effective test cases and thinking through difficult edge cases will clearly communicate the intention of specific stories. Investing sufficient time in assembling test cases with a software developer in test will amply reduce future re-work. Using the Gherkin framework has greatly helped me communicate specific scenarios that need to be tested in order for the ticket to be considered “Done”.Link to Gherkin: https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/A clear understanding of what comprises a back-end ticket on your team vs. what comprises a front-end ticket can take a while to iron out. This can be challenging because making sure that back-end tickets either precede or are worked on in parallel with their front end counterparts (if any) is a basic task you will have to perform. Having full-stack developers on your team that are capable of working on both front-end and back-end tickets is great for velocity. However, the old adage of two heads being greater than one applies here. Breaking up front end and back end tickets provides another layer of oversight that would otherwise be foregone. This will surely enhance the overall quality and health of any codebase.Understanding the basic structure of an API’s head and the body can be very telling of what a given endpoint is designed to do. Let’s say you have an API call that saves the type of car an individual saves to their wish-list to a database. If you look at the body and don’t see a line that deals with colour, chances are colour will not be tracked by this specific API. All UI elements that users interact with will either be handled through front-end logic or will have an API that is wired up to them that passes certain data to an endpoint.Take for example a simple modal with a save and cancel button. The cancel button’s functionality will likely be handled on the front end and result in the modal being closed. The save function will, in contrast, make a call to the back end to save whatever interactions a user has with a UI to the database.To determine whether whether a given UI will need to make an API call, ask yourself if the change your user is making should persist at a later state (assuming you are not caching on the front end).In poor cultures, there can sometimes be a feeling of Product ‘happening’ to the development function. That is to say that there can be a perception of product and dev working in separate silos, with product giving dev requirements to work towards and dev executing towards those requirements.https://twitter.com/villaumbrosia/status/1459191004519673857In a good application of agile that couldn’t be further from the truth. Getting your team involved early on in the discovery phase will surely make your team feel more engaged and add fidelity to your work. So you don’t stray too far down the wrong path before realizing there are better alternatives or what you’re working on is not feasible!Bonus points if you have a basic understanding of how branching and pull requests (PRs) work. This can prove to be a valuable skillset in running a scrum team. It helps understand dependencies and blockers on code merges. Here is a link to a good article on branching:https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branchesKnowing the merge path of PRs put up by your team can go a long way in helping estimate when critical merges will make their way to all your organization’s environments. It is quite common for organizations to have a ‘canary’ environment where there is a limited number of clients who are the first ones impacted by a code merge. The idea is that this limits any adverse impact these merges may have. In return clients on these canary environments often pay a reduced fee. The typical deploy path I’ve seen is dev to canary and then finally to all production.In my next post I’ll talk about working with the design and QA teams.

We can agree on that.But maybe we need to give credit more to the design of the incentives of the culture and the environment we’ve created.It’s possible that maybe we’ve designed a culture and environment that:Pushes fast-paced, high stress, always-achieving lifestyles that incentivize a dopamine-filled escape in the form of phonesIncentivizes suburban single family homes, car-centric and human-desolate roads/infrastructure that no one would want to walk onSubsidizes fast food and cheap corn crops to create a hyper-caloric environment at every corner in grocery stores and chain restaurantsSo yes, ultimately, the individual responsibility is in your hands.But let’s also acknowledge that everything is working as designed.Product ManagementDesignCulture----More from BootcampFollowFrom idea to product, one lesson at a time.

Articles, books, and videos have been published, and PLG has become a household name for any product manager in the software industry.On the most superficial level, PLG means building products that are simple to use, display their value very quickly, and can be purchased in a fully self-serve manner (usually starting with a freemium or free-trial account). Sales are made without contacting any human, enabling a company to scale up sales and revenue without additional personnel to support the growing operation. Sounds like every company’s dream, right?But what if your company and product were not built with a PLG mindset and methods? Does it mean that you missed the PLG train and are doomed to be shackled to long, tedious, high-friction sales cycles until the end of time? The answer is definitely NO. But brace yourself: The journey won’t be easy or short. It will require cross-organization collaboration and a mindset shift in how you design, build, and evaluate your product and incorporate new tools and work methods. Despite the great effort, the unlocked potential of implementing a PLG method is enormous.At Kaltura, a 16 years old NASDAQ-traded company whose customers include many Fortune 500 companies and leading educational institutions from across the globe, we started implementing PLG methods when we launched our very first self-serve offering at the end of 2021. We decided to try this approach as part of a cross-company effort that included re-designing many of our products and experimenting with new marketing and sales strategies.This post will define some key aspects of adopting a PLG strategy and suggest how to implement them based on our experience at Kaltura.The road to implementing PLG is long and curvyWhat is a sales-led company?Before we dive into the details, let’s briefly define what I mean by “enterprise-grade” or “sales-led.” First and foremost, customers MUST contact a person to subscribe to your product. Usually, it also means that you are not selling to individuals or SMBs since those deals are too small to “waste” your sales force’s time on. Therefore, your sales cycle is quite long, and it can take up to a year to close some deals involving multiple people from your organization and including numerous demos to various customer stakeholders.After signing the deal, you should guide the customer during the onboarding process and help them set up their account to answer their own specific use cases. It might be connecting to their Single Sign On, white-labeling your product to the customer’s branding, or integrating with the third-party service they “must have’’ to gain the full value from your product.Most customers also require ongoing support and a dedicated CSM to make the most out of the product. Feature requests are also common when enterprise customers are involved, and failing to provide relevant features on time might result in losing business to your competitors. In other words, your whole roadmap changes.Other challenges of enterprise-/sales-led organizations include:Lack of focus on the end-user experience — when the IT department makes the decision about renewing your contract, who cares about the user.Complex, patchy products — adding features ad-hoc based on a single customer’s request or to win a specific deal instead of developing your product holistically leads to endless configurations and a product that can’t be used without your guidance.Collecting, measuring, and analyzing data the wrong way — asking “how much” a particular feature is used instead of examining your product as a whole.Not talking to users — without talking to actual users, you will never discover your product’s true pain points and barriers.Sound familiar? You’ve come to the right place.Four steps to start implementing a PLG strategyNow that we’ve established what a sales-led company is and what benefits such companies can gain from PLG methods, let’s dive into what is actually required to implement those methods in your organization.1. Define your personasThe first thing you need to do is to define your target audience (persona) very accurately. Focusing on the wrong audience can be very costly and frustrating since leads you paid good money for will not convert. It can take some time to nail your audience, but the long-term value is massive after you succeed once.At Kaltura, we spent a lot of time characterizing the exact persona for all our products. This process began with analyzing existing customers’ data, website visitors’ data, and many user interviews.2. Prepare your dataThen you need to make sure you are collecting the right data. You need to fully understand your product’s offering and ask yourself, “Why are people using my product and not the competitors’?” That’s the true value of your product and the famous “A-Ha Moment” you want your users to achieve. It should be very easy to get a unanimous answer across the organization.Now, ensure you are collecting ALL the relevant data to measure accurately if users are actually using your product as expected and to find out what prevents them from doing so if they are not. When I talk about data, I don’t mean only quantitative data on product usage but also qualitative data, such as user interviews and screen recordings. This is the only way to locate your product’s flaws and fix them.At Kaltura, this process began by labeling all the buttons and pages in our products to get data on all button clicks and page loads. Later, we started tracking server events, such as “file uploaded” or “playlist created.” We analyze this data, alongside page views and button clicks, with Mixpanel. In addition, we use Hotjar to get screen recordings of all new users and paint a complete picture of product usage from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective.It goes without saying that any data gathering and analysis should always be transparent and consensual, especially under regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.Data preparation and tracking are crucial for a successful PLG motion3. Calibrate your metricsAfter defining personas and gathering data, you need to align your metrics. I know that “daily active users” and “free-to-paid conversion” rates are the natural candidates, but at your first steps into PLG, your North Star metric should be activation.Activation is defined per product and represents the moment you want every new user to achieve as soon as possible after subscribing to your product (the “A-Ha Moment”). For example, Zoom considers activation to be completing a meeting within seven days of signup, and for Zapier, it’s setting up a Zap.Carefully define your activation metric, the action that causes the user to understand the true value of your product, and track it tediously. Only an increase in activation will lift the rest of your business metrics. The industry benchmark for activation is 20%, so don’t feel bad if yours is a single digit at the beginning.We learned that the activation North Star metric for our Virtual Classroom product is “meaningful sessions,” i.e., a session of more than 20 minutes with more than two participants. Users with more meaningful sessions were upgrading their trials to paid subscriptions significantly more than other users.But, usually, there are other actions the user needs to do before getting to activation. This is when you start drilling down to the data to understand what characterizes users that get to activation. For us, it was uploading files, inviting users, and creating playlists.4. Build an onboarding experienceLastly, you should build a killer product onboarding. In the PLG game, good onboarding is key to success. Even the best products with the most impressive features need to give their users a set of training wheels before they can start riding. The onboarding experience should feel native to your product, and the user should not feel bombarded at first login. You should carefully select the key actions in your product and gently nudge the user toward them.To emphasize the importance of good onboarding, studies show that 40%-60% of new users will never return to your product. This is why you should ace the onboarding — it’s your only way to get new users to see your value on their first visit before they leave and never return.We decided to go with a short four-step checklist for user onboarding, focusing on the key actions that lead to activation (“meaningful sessions”). The checklist is short and precise, with clear call-to-actions and demonstrations of how the user can perform any of the actions. For example, when clicking on the “Upload course materials” step, the user is directed to the “Files” folder with the “Add file” button highlighted. Since releasing the onboarding checklist, all the core actions leading to activation increased by 20%-40% each, leading to a significant increase in activation and conversion.Kaltura Virtual Classroom onboarding checklistClosing notesOverwhelmed? Good, you should be. The PLG way comes hand-in-hand with detailed work and ongoing research, and there is much more to discuss on how a sales-led organization can adopt it alongside its old ways. You will need the following:Product managers and product designers working full-time on PLG initiatives for your existing product stack.Business stakeholders to build new price models for your new no-touch offerings.Dedicated marketing efforts to bring new types of leads for these offerings.Training for your existing sales team or new sales personnel to convert low-revenue, no-touch customers to medium-revenue, low-touch customers.A new support team for the no-touch customers.A vast learning hub, so the no-touch customers don’t need to contact humans to answer their product questions.And that’s not to mention the mechanism you will need to implement for managing subscriptions, billing, and credit cards.As I already said, PLG isn’t easy, but it’s the more sustainable way to expand a software business. It will benefit your entire organization, your customers, and — most importantly — your product. It will force you to tackle the most significant pain points of your product, or else your users will churn very quickly. This is the biggest value you will get from PLG and will benefit you immensely down the road.Product ManagementPlgProduct Led Growth----More from Kaltura TechnologyStories, case studies and insights about Software Engineering, Research, Data, Architecture, Product development, Scaling and more, written by our very own engineers, product developers and data scientists.Read more from Kaltura TechnologyRecommended from MediumPriyam SrivastavaProduct Dimensions & User StoryLaura KleininThe StartupA Framework for Making Better Product Decisions — Users KnowMeland.aiCommunity Tool UpdatesAnimorph Co-opIterating unknown vectorsSumit BatraHow Agile Methodology Changed the Way we Deliver Value to Customers?Product SouthCarly’s Product Management JourneyHarbr Inc.Harbr Platform “Lite”Chris ShayanInnovation Maturity ModelAboutHelpTermsPrivacyGet the Medium appGet unlimited accessTom Schifter20 FollowersProduct ManagerFollowHelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech

From 3 of these articles, I was able to compile a list of 26 reasons:Lack of market focus (a.k.a. segmentation).Excessive pace of product improvement.Incomplete products.Too much capital.Channel mismanagement.Failure to establish the right competitive barriers.Using price alone to attract mainstream buyers.Improper use of advertising.Misinterpretation of the innovation-adoption process.Irrelevant market research.The company can’t support fast growth.The product falls short of claims and gets bashed.The new item exists in “product limbo”.The product defines a new category and requires substantial consumer education.The product is revolutionary, but there’s no market for it.No product-market fit.Solving the wrong problem.Aiming for “perfect” instead of “done”.Not gathering regular feedback from customers.Iterating too slowly.Using incorrect assumptions about your customers.Pricing your product wrong.Not enough market or industry research.Investing in the wrong areas of your business.Problems with your competition.Poor execution.And the list can certainly grow bigger. The Verge put together a list of 84 biggest flops, fails, and dead dreams of the decade (2010–2019) in tech, including big failures from Amazon, Google, Apple, Netflix, and Microsoft.The most common reason for product failureBehind many of the reasons and failures above, we can certainly find a common behavior, going straight from problem discovery to solution delivery with little to no solution discovery. When talking with my clients about their product discovery, they normally describe situations like:We did deep user research, and we found problem X, which users want to get solved to the point that they will pay for a good solution, so we decided to build solution Y, but now that we delievered solution Y we are seeing very low adoption…This happened because they skipped the solution discovery, going from problem discovery straight to solution delivery. Let me repeat this because this is really, really important:The most common reason for product failure is going straight from problem discovery to solution delivery.As I mentioned in a previous article, discovery is a set of tools to help us mitigate product development risks. Discovering a problem is easy. Discovering a solution is hard and requires product managers, designers, and engineers to develop possible solutions. Then they need to assess the solutions to determine if at least one works and, if yes, and more than one works, which one has the greatest chance of success.Sometimes the solution discovery confirms which product or feature we need to deliver, and the product — or feature — delivery is a success. However, there are other times when the solution discovery shows us that we cannot come up with a solution that has a chance of success, which is good. It is good because it will spare us a lot of time and energy from working on delivering a solution that will fail. We need to invest in solution discovery to avoid product failures.Solution discovery can be a prototype, but it can also be other things like a landing page, where we draw traffic to understand if there’s demand, or a spreadsheet, where we assess the business viability of a certain solution. As I mentioned earlier, discovery is a set of tools to help us mitigate product development risks. There are many tools for the many types of risks in the product development process.Last week I was talking to a client who had a very interesting solution idea to a certain problem that she discovered that the majority of her customers had. Still, when she decided to run some numbers, she understood that the solution was not financially viable, i.e., the amount of money she would receive from customers would not be enough to pay all the costs to serve the product. And this was good because she was able to spare all the time and money she would invest in building a solution that would become a failure.A real-life example — a Locaweb product that never came to lifeWhen I was at Locaweb, the biggest web hosting and internet company in Brazil, around 2010, we discovered that some potential customers didn’t want to use the existing website builders and were looking for web design professionals, but without enough knowledge about how to manage the work with this professional. As we had experience building websites, we thought we could manage this relationship with web design professionals for the customer.We were very excited about the opportunity, and we designed a solution. We were already having some discussions on how to deliver it. However, before delivering, i.e., building the solution, we decided to build a prototype to present it to some potential customers and learn from their reactions and feedback.When we presented the solution prototype to potential customers, it put a dumper on our excitement. We wanted to be the middle person, making it clear that we would do our best to help the customer get a good website, but we didn’t want to be responsible for any misconduct from web design professionals. We wanted that the system became self-regulated through the common 1 to 5 stars rating. When we built our prototype — a one-week effort — and then presented it to potential customers, almost all wanted us to pay some fine for non-delivery or late fees in case things didn’t go as expected.We made changes to the prototype to present the product in alternative ways to clarify Locaweb’s and the web designers’ roles and responsibilities, but without success. That’s when we decided to cancel the product development. We were very glad we did it, and we then learned how important it is to make solution discovery before putting energy and resources into delivering a full product.Solution discovery is a very powerful yet simple and cheap way to increase the success rate of our product development efforts. However, many teams ignore it and go from problem discovery to solution delivery. If we had done so in this Locaweb example I just described, it would most certainly be a big failure. It would generate a lot of headaches for Locaweb, our product development team, and our customers.Summing upThe most common reason for product failure is going straight from problem discovery to solution delivery.Discovery is a set of tools to help us mitigate product development risks.Discovering a problem is easy. Discovering a solution is hard and requires product managers, designers, and engineers to develop possible solutions. Then they need to assess the solutions to determine if at least one works and, if yes, and if more than one works, which one has the greatest chance of success.Sometimes the solution discovery confirms which product or feature we need to deliver, and the product — or feature — delivery is a success.Sometimes the solution discovery shows us that we cannot come up with a solution that has a chance of success. This is good since it will spare us a lot of time and energy from working on delivering a solution that will fail.

When consumers are faced with economic uncertainty, they may be more likely to cut back on their spending or to switch to cheaper alternatives. This can make it difficult for businesses to attract new customers and can lead to a decline in revenue.In this context, retention becomes especially important as a way to help maintain a stable customer base and to ensure that a business is able to continue generating income. By focusing on retaining existing customers, businesses can potentially offset any losses from declining demand or reduced spending. Retaining customers can be much more cost-effective than trying to attract new ones, as it often costs less to retain an existing customer than to acquire a new one.For product managers, this means that it’s important to prioritize retention efforts and to focus on building customer loyalty and satisfaction. This may involve offering incentives for repeat business, providing excellent customer service, and consistently delivering high-quality products. By focusing on retention, product managers can help to ensure that their products and businesses are able to weather economic challenges and emerge stronger on the other side.Communicating in the futureThe future of the product management profession is likely to be marked by an increasing focus on the ability to work effectively, accurately, and quickly - in cross-functional teams. In order to succeed in this role, product managers will need to have strong tooling and communication skills, as well as the ability to navigate and adapt to changing market conditions.By staying leveraging tools like AI for automation, teams can move faster while staying better aligned.Product managers of the future will need to be exceptional at driving interdisciplinary teams. In order to be successful, product managers will need to be able to effectively communicate the big picture vision as well as the detailed functional specifications to a variety of stakeholders, including engineers, designers, sales teams, and customers.Big Picture Vision ThinkingAs a product leader, it is important to have a strong sense of the “big picture” and to be able to think strategically about the long-term vision for the product. This means considering the needs and goals of the business, as well as the needs and expectations of the target audience.In addition, the ability to anticipate market large trend cycles will continue to be an important skill for product managers who want to stay ahead and develop successful products in the future. We recommend Jane McGonigal’s Futures Thinking specialization in Coursera.Some key considerations for big picture vision thinking include:Being in-touch with market opportunities and trendsDefining the value proposition and differentiators for the productSetting clear goals and objectives for the productDeveloping a roadmap for the product’s evolution over timeEnsuring alignment with the overall business strategyNuts & Bolts Thinking: Written Functional SpecificationsIn addition to thinking about the big picture, product managers also need to be able to translate the vision into specific technical requirements for the development team. This involves working closely with the development team to define the functionalities and features of the product, as well as the technical specifications and constraints.Some key considerations for technical functional specifications include:Identifying and prioritizing the most important features and functionalityDefining the user flows and interactions for each featureSpecifying technical requirements, such as performance, security, and scalabilityDefining acceptance criteria for each feature to ensure that it meets the desired standardsCollaborating with the development team to ensure that the technical specifications are feasible and aligned with the overall product vision.Ensuring that the visual prototypes accurately reflect the desired functionality and user experienceIdentifying and documenting the specific elements of the visual prototypes, such as buttons, forms, and navigation elementsSpecifying the desired behavior and functionality for each element, including any interactions or animationsDefining the acceptance criteria for each element to ensure that it meets the desired standards for functionality and designCollaborating with the engineering and QA teams to ensure that the specifications are clear and complete, and to resolve any questions or issues that may arise during the development process.Optimizing your product team’s workflowThis may involve streamlining your development cycle, identifying areas where you can cut costs, and automating the most impactful workflows. Using AI to automate time-intensive workflows can also help to optimize your product team’s productivity, and free up valuable time from repetitive or low-value tasks, and focus on more strategic and impactful work. Some common workflows that can be automated include specification writing, test case documentation, data entry, and reporting.Some examples of automation benefits:Increased Efficiency: By streamlining the development cycle and automating certain workflows, you can help your team to work more efficiently. This means that they will be able to complete tasks more quickly, freeing up time for more strategic and impactful work. Improved efficiency can also help to reduce the risk of delays or bottlenecks in the development process, which can have a positive impact on the overall timeline for the product.Improved Productivity: Optimizing your team’s workflow can also help to improve productivity. By automating low-value tasks, you can free up your team’s time and allow them to focus on more strategic and impactful work. Additionally, by identifying areas where you can cut costs, you can free up resources that can be used to drive innovation and improve the product.Higher Quality Products: Another key benefit of optimizing your product team’s workflow is the potential for higher quality products. By streamlining the development cycle and automating certain workflows, you can help to reduce the risk of errors or defects in the product. This can result in higher customer satisfaction and loyalty, as well as a stronger reputation for your business.In conclusion, optimizing your product team’s workflow, focusing on nuts and bolts thinking, and having a strong sense of big picture vision are all essential components of successful product management. By adopting these approaches, you can help your team to work more efficiently, deliver high-quality products, and drive sustainable growth for your business. Additionally, effective communication is key for ensuring that your team is aligned and working towards common goals, and a retention-driven approach can help you to build customer loyalty and drive success for your products. By leveraging these strategies, you can help your product team to thrive in the face of uncertainty.Kris Kohl is a product leader and co-founder of DESIGN2TEXT.COMProduct ManagementProductivityArtificial IntelligenceEconomicsAgile----More from Kris KohlFollowAI & the future of product managementLove podcasts or audiobooks?

A leader in this space stated he thought coding and design skills are a must. I almost spit out my coffee and respectfully disagreed. I’m sure you have heard that Product Managers must be obsessed with the problem not the solution. If they have an engineering and or design background they are then sitting in the solution space. This is how we encounter unconscious bias. I respectfully responded that I would state a more lucrative bonus would be to have an analytical mindset that is able to gather data and make appropriate conclusions from those insights. This allows you to widen your knowledge and really put yourself in your customer’s shoes. This is also a great way to gain solid empathy, which is another positive trait of Product Managers.I get it, data can be overwhelming, like a dark abyss with no beginning or end. Does this sound familiar? You log an IT ticket to request access to “data and insights” at your company. You receive an email stating that you have been given permissions to the corporate database that contains various schemas, and tables with absolutely no knowledge of which equate to your Product. How in the world can this be understood if you don’t know how to navigate around Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Snowflake, or any other number of database management systems? Do you start to blindly search for anyone within the company with DBA in their title? The first thing to do is not to panic. Before you even login, decide what you’d like to achieve with this data. Such as which metrics would you like to decipher.I did various research on several Product Analytics sites to see if there was a common thread with respect to which metrics to track. They list the following as the most crucial winners: engagement, revenue, conversion, retention, activation, active usage, and NPS or Net Promoter Scores.But before you try to tackle all of them at once, find out what is most important to you in your particular situation. For instance how mature is your Product? What customers would you like to target? Have you received feedback from sales, support, and other departments that need prioritized attention? Answering those questions will then lead you to the most important metric.If, as a Product Manager, you are making assumptions about your data this could be catastrophic to your Product as you could ultimately lose revenue on missed opportunities.That being said, I do not believe that any Product Manager should be an expert in SQL. However, knowing where your data resides and how to interpret it is crucial in moving forward with the Product Discovery process. It should be stated, that this is never a substitution for speaking to your customers.Product ManagementProduct AnalyticsData----More from Eva BeasleyFollowOriginally from Philadelphia, I have a Rocky Balboa mentality.

As a product manager, using this technique makes sure that you do not miss big risks that need to be mitigated before Engineering & Design starts building it.To use the pre-mortem technique, you first select a project or endeavour and then imagine that it has failed spectacularly. Next, you list out every potential cause of failure that you can foresee and come up with actionable steps to address each one. By identifying and addressing potential issues before they occur, you can increase the chances of success for your project.Let’s sayAs a product manager, you are responsible for launching a new smartphone. Before you even begin development, you decide to conduct a pre-mortem to identify potential causes of failure. You imagine that the launch has failed spectacularly and ask yourself what could have caused this failure. Some potential causes of failure that you come up with might include:Poor product design or functionalityInsufficient market research leading to a product that does not meet customer needsManufacturing defects or supply chain issuesMarketing and branding efforts that do not effectively communicate the value of the productCompetition from other products with similar featuresFor each of these potential causes of failure, you come up with actionable steps to address them.For example, you might decide to invest in additional market research to better understand customer needs, work with your engineering team to refine the product design, establish relationships with reliable suppliers, develop a comprehensive marketing plan, and monitor the competition to ensure that your product stands out in the market.By addressing these potential issues before the launch, you increase your chances of success and are better prepared to handle any challenges that may arise.PitfallsThere are a few potential pitfalls to be aware of when using the pre-mortem technique:Groupthink: Groupthink, which is when a group’s desire for consensus overrides their judgment and leads to poor decision-making, can occur if people are afraid to speak up or challenge the opinions of others.Unrealistic assumptions: It is important to be realistic when identifying potential causes of failure, rather than making unrealistic assumptions or overstating the likelihood of certain events occurring. This can lead to unnecessary efforts being put into addressing unlikely scenarios, which can be a waste of time and resources.Neglecting to address identified risks: Identifying potential causes of failure is only useful if you actually take action to address them. It is important to prioritise and address the most significant risks first.Over-reliance on the technique: While the pre-mortem technique can be a useful tool. Over-reliance on the pre-mortem alone can lead to a lack of flexibility and adaptability when facing uncertain challenges.SummaryIdentify potential causes of failure: Before you even begin a project, take the time to imagine that it has failed spectacularly and identify potential causes of failure.Come up with actionable steps to address potential risks: For each potential cause of failure, come up with specific steps that you can take to address it. This can help you to be more prepared and increase your chances of success.Encourage open and honest discussion: When conducting the pre-mortem in a group setting, it is important to encourage open and honest discussion to identify a wide range of potential causes of failure.Be realistic: It is important to be realistic when identifying potential causes of failure, rather than making unrealistic assumptions or overstating the likelihood of certain events occurring.Follow through on identified risks: Identifying potential causes of failure is only useful if you actually take action to address them.Suggested Resources:Pre-mortems: How a Stripe Product Manager predicts & prevents problems before launch (coda.io)Shreyas Doshi on Twitter: “Twitter, now that we understand why the preventable problem paradox is so prevalent and pernicious, it’s time to talk about combating it.

They generate ideas about the development of the product. Product managers are considered to be one of the essential pillars that provide support to an organization or a company.There are many types of product managers. In the developing years, there has been a rise in one of the types of PMs: The Growth PM.Who is a Growth Product Manager?A product manager broadly defines someone who manages a product. So, a “growth” PM manages the growth part of the product (email, in-app, etc.). It’s slightly similar to PMM, but the difference is that the growth PM has to set the roadmap of what tools are built and experiments run to enable growth. Additionally, growth PMs are more tightly tied to revenue and engagement metrics.Definition-wise, Growth product managers are the product managers who are responsible for identifying the growth of a company or an institution and directing the teams accordingly to reach the goal. They show involvement in growth marketing.Growth PMGrowth PMDifferent companies view the role of growth PM differently. Sinduja Ramanujam, a senior PM at Microsoft, sees it as a unique role at an intersection of product development and marketing. Willie Tran, a growth PM at Dropbox, has a different opinion. Willie explained in this talk at tech business school that the growing role is mostly centred around product development, not marketing. Willie says a growth product manager can rethink a business model.Role of Growth PMThe role of a Growth PM starts with assessing the growth goals of a company. A growth product manager begins his job by gathering quality data which is the basis of growth product management. The growth PMs also track the metrics that help them to identify when the opportunity for improvement arises, and also to assess the results of any project introduced in the market. This is done with the help of KPIs and other metric models.Role of Growth PMGrowth PM not only works internally but also looks at the external aspects. They have the responsibility to analyze customer behaviour through user feedback, usability tests, and other surveys which helps them to understand the needs and demands of the customers. The Growth PMs also make tests and surveys for the users.About Growth PMThe definition of the role has shifted based on company needs. Initially, it was all about optimizing for sign-ups — email acquisition, working on registration/sign-in funnels, working on metrics and funnels from ad spend, etc. Then it became more of a focus on re-engaging long-inactive users — everything from new content to bringing them into new funnels for re-registering them. Now it’s becoming more about the cross-pollination of features, finding ways to get users who engage with one product set introduced to others (plus everything else listed above). This increased growth marketing.Difference between a Conventional PM and a Growth PMConventional PMGrowth PMResponsibility is confined to a single product.Responsible for overlooking multiple products.The primary stakeholder of a conventional PM is the customer.The primary stakeholder of a growth PM is the business of the company or the organization.Some of the skills of a conventional PM include problem-solving ability, tending to be risk averse, analytical skills, etc.Some of the skills of the growth PM include experimental nature, a curious personality, and an excellent ability to collaborate.Skills of a Growth PMCommunication skill: This is the most basic and most significant skill required by a growth PM. A growth PM must have strong communication skills to increase growth marketing and have positive user feedback from clients.Scientific Mindset: Scientific mindset not only includes being experimental but also having the temperament to be curious and skeptical about the processes during the product life cycle. A growth PM with a scientific mindset is not shy to face challenges and do thorough research about everything.Having a better understanding of the user journey: Growth PMs should know every step of product development and also have an understanding of the users’ experience with a product.Analytical Skills: Growth PMs should have good analytical skills which will help them to analyze the gathered data and use it to their advantage. They can also use multiple analytical tools to evaluate the user journey, product metrics, and user feedback.Diplomatic Interpersonal Skills: A growth PM needs to have good communication skills and the best negotiation skills. They should practice the art of saying no and persuade the customers to their favour for the greater good.Scope of a Growth PMThe basic role and responsibility of a Growth PM are the same in different companies and organizations. However, there might be some variations depending on the size and maturity of a business. The team of a growth product manager consists of engineers, marketers, data scientists, designers, and more.The scope of a Growth PM is better in well-established companies where the Growth PMs have their team and better resources to give better results. In start-ups or small companies, Growth PMs need to prove their value over time. This is because they don’t provide excellent results quickly as they don’t get sufficient means and face risky experimentation in a project.ConclusionGrowth PMs have proved to be a crucial link between the users and the product. They help in the growth of a product during its development by understanding what a customer wants.A career as a Growth PM is promising.SummaryThe article tells in detail about the Growth of Product Managers. Growth product managers are the product managers who are responsible for identifying the growth of a company or an institution and directing the teams accordingly to reach the goal. A Growth PM gathers data, track metrics, and also analyze customer behaviour to understand their needs and demands. The Growth PM is responsible for overlooking multiple products. The primary stakeholder of a growth PM is the business of the company or the organization. The skills of a growth PM include communication skills, having a scientific mindset and a better understanding of the user journey, analytical skills, and diplomatic interpersonal skills. All this helps in getting positive user feedback as well as enhancement in growth marketing.Visit Prowess, a platform for product managers that will help you break into product management.ProductProduct ManagementProduct ManagerGrowth HackingGrowth----More from Agile InsiderExclusive and practical insights that enable the agile community to succeed.Read more from Agile InsiderRecommended from MediumRobert WallaceBehavioral Interviewing for Product Leaders — Part 1David DeVoreinUX CollectiveProduct management needs full-triangle buildersKamal Kannan SankarrajinThe StartupIs There a Framework for David to Take on the Goliath in the Consumer Product Space?Future FriendlyProduct Managers don’t need eight limbsSri Balaji GopinathSwitching gears to product managementBhramari BishtinProduct AlchemistProduct Manager Learnings -2021TozanA|B Testing Arbitrary Product VersionsEnsemble SystemsAdobe Workfront + AEM — The common use casesAboutHelpTermsPrivacyGet the Medium appGet unlimited accessSoham Sharma243 FollowersData Science Enthusiast | Entrepreneur | Digital Marketer | Martial Artist | Chatbot DesignerFollowHelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech

50,how-to-lead-an-efficient-retrospective,https://www.medium.com/@nfoulon/how-to-lead-an-efficient-retrospective-5d35a82e83b0?source=topics_v2---------124-84--------------------04bcbe07_c9bb_4c04_a9c1_aae6ece02a3a-------17,"How to lead an efficient retrospective | by Nicolas Foulon | Dec, 2022 | MediumNicolas FoulonFollowDec 19·10 min readHow to lead an efficient retrospectiveThis article aims to give you the keys to organising efficient and impactful retrospectives — and avoiding the situation above ⬆️.The retrospective is a privileged communication time. It allows the team to congratulate itself on recent successes and take time to reflect on what didn’t work so well and could be improved.Ultimately, the objective of the retrospective is to identify improvements or new practices to help the team to be more efficient.At Yousign, 3 types of retrospectives are organised regularly.1) Squad’s retrospectiveWhy: Create a team spirit within the Squad and review the past iteration to improve the delivery practices with specific actions.Who: All squad members (developers, product managers, engineering manager, quality assistance).When: Once at the end of the sprint or every 2–3 weeks if you work in Kanban.How long: 1 hour is usually enough.2) End-of-initiative’s retrospectiveWhy: Reflect on a finished initiative and identify what went well and what could be done better next time to capitalise on our experience.Who: Acting members of the initiative and stakeholders involved.When: One week or two after the end of an initiative or after an important release.How long: it depends on the initiative but usually it takes between 1,5 and 2 hours.3) Product team’s retrospectiveWhy: Identify the key factors leading to the team’s success and agree on actions to drive even better results.Who: Product Team members (Product Managers, Product Marketing Managers, Product Designers).When: Once every quarter.How long: it depends on the team’s size but it usually takes between 2 and 3 hours.How to prepare the retrospectiveYou can consider this part as a step-by-step guide to follow to organise a retrospective — of course, it should be adapted to your context, needs and organisation.This guide is focused on “End-of-initiative retrospective” but it can easily be adapted to any kind of retrospective.Details can be found belowGood preparation is a key factor for the success of your retrospective. All in all, it should take you around one hour and will ensure that everyone attending this meeting has the right mindset when the time of the retrospective comes.List the attendantsWork on your casting. The retrospective is a privileged time to put all stakeholders in a room for a short period: don’t forget anyone. You should include both people who have been working as contributors and decision-makers.Don’t invite too many people. Having more than 12 people in a retrospective may induce animation difficulties and people might speak less freely. Three options can be considered if you feel that too many people are invited :Choose a representative for each team, or ask their manager who should be included.Organise for the engineering team a separate retrospective focused on the delivery part of the project. Even in that case, at least one person from the engineering team should be invited, it is usually the engineering manager.Split the group into two balanced sub-groups and organise two retrospectives at the same time.Find a pilotA good animator has to be as neutral as possible and is ideally not involved in the project to avoid biases. That’s why it is challenging to both animate and participate in a retrospective.The best solution here is to ask for help from one of your favourite colleagues who is not involved in this project. Beware, you will have to return the favour sooner or later. Starting here the pilot should be involved in all the following steps of the preparation.Choose the formatMany retrospective formats exist and I won’t advise any of them. However, two things have to be considered:Choose a format which fits with the type of output that you aim for. For example, you may want to have an action-oriented retrospective or just focus on the strengths and weaknesses of the team.Consider that it may be the first retrospective for some of the attendants so avoid a more advanced format like the Sailboat.The pilot may help you to find the right format.From my experience, the Keep Drop Start is a good start and is very action-oriented. If you have regular retrospectives with your squad then you have many opportunities to explore new formats and take turns animating.Book a slot in the calendarThis step may be the trickiest of the entire process and should be anticipated. You have to choose a date which fits everyone’s schedule and which is not too far from the end of the project.If few people can’t make it at all, you can consider gathering their feedback before the main event. The pilot will be the right person to share the feedback with the group.Prepare the slide deckThe slide deck is an essential tool to convey key messages to the participant. It should always — at least — include those three parts, even for the most experienced teams :Why it’s important to do a retrospective. What are the expected outcomes and how those learnings will be leveraged to be better in the future.A short reminder of the project’s timeline. Not all people worked full-time on the project and know what happened in detail. It is even more important if it was a long-term projectThe basic but essential rules to follow to have an efficient retrospective. This part may seem odd or obvious but it is always useful to remind people that we are not here to finger-point people and that we expect everyone to be in a positive and constructive mindset. It doesn’t mean that we can’t disagree but it means that we have to do it constructively. Here is an example of guidelines.Here are the basic rules to share and apply :People shouldn’t be interruptedMocking people is not acceptableWhat is said can be kept privateBy following these rules you set up the right conditions for the success of the retrospective. As the animator, you are the one in charge to make sure that those rules are applied.Once again, the pilot may help you to build this slide deck but he is not the main player here.Share the slide deck with all the participantsSharing the slides beforehand helps people to know what to expect and this should be done around one week before the retrospective. A reminder should also be sent two days before D-Day.Two things should be asked of the participants as you share the slide deck:Give feedback about the timeline since everyone can have a different perspective on past events.Prepare what they plan to say, so when they arrive at the meeting with the most important things to share in mind.The preparation level highly depends on the profile of the people you invited, so don’t be harsh on yourself if some (or all) of them haven’t prepared anything. If the slide deck has been shared and a reminder has been sent then you did your job!How to animate the retrospectiveToolsI won’t earn anything by saying that - but my favourite tool so far is metroretro.io. It is a free and easy-to-use tool which has this amazing feature to hide or show sticky notes. For those who plan to lead a retrospective in real life, sticky notes and markers are your friends, just make sure to have a wall (not made of brick otherwise the sticky notes won’t stick) or a board at your disposal.AnimationFor this step, I will assume that you chose the Keep Drop Start. However, what follows can be applied to all formats with a divergent and a convergent part.The animation of this meeting should be led by the pilot, the project leader will only intervene to present the timeline of the project.1) IntroductionThis part should last around ten minutes and is dedicated to presenting the slide deck prepared beforehand. It is a perfect occasion to remind everyone what is expected and what is going to happen.2) DivergencePeople list what they have in mind for each category (Keep, Drop, Start and questions). If you have many participants or a short timeframe, you can set a limit of 3 or 5 post-its by category per person.Then, participants share one after another what they wrote explaining shortly what they have in mind. At this point, it’s very important to be as brief as possible because you will have time after to discuss each topic. Shared sticky notes should not be discussed by the group just yet, a dedicated time comes for that right after.3) ConvergenceActually, for the pilot and yourself, the convergence phase begins when people start to share their sticky notes. The objective is to group feedback by theme in real time so once everyone has presented their ideas, you just have to decide with the team which topic should be discussed first.Don’t hesitate to ask people for their opinion about each topic, ask questions, ask “why ?”, and make sure that everyone has the opportunity to speak out. The result of those discussions for each topic should be a list of actions to improve the way the group works together. If you don’t find the solution right away, a good idea may be to wonder what should be done to tend to a better situation, it may be “organise a workshop to gather ideas” or “speak with Axelle the CTO about this problem”.Three things are important when you define an action :It should contain a verb otherwise it’s not an actionSomeone should be responsible for this actionA deadline or timing should be setDuring this step, you should speak about the most important topics first since it’s highly probable that you won’t have time to go through all the topics.If some topics are not addressed, you can propose to deal with them asynchronously or set a short dedicated meeting with the people concerned.A retrospective meeting is also a place to celebrate successes. Before jumping to what should be improved, take some time to summarise what went well.I’m leading a retrospective with people I’m working with, what could go wrong?Not everything always goes as planned, here is a list of common situations that you may face and ideas to solve them:—People not wanting to share or not finding the space to share 🤐Explanation: It can come from many reasons. Some people might be shy, and afraid to speak in public, in front of stakeholders or in front of their manager. Some people might also not have a specific opinion about a specific topic. Others might not be as invested as you could expect and don’t want to actively participate in this kind of meeting.Possible solutions: make sure to regularly ask this participant if he wants to share something about the current topic.—People being aggressive 🔫Explanation: It can be a symptom of pressurised people or just a defence mechanism. Keep in mind that people have different ways to communicate, which means that a sentence that you perceived as aggressive might not be perceived the same by the one saying it.Possible solutions: Don’t let it go once, as soon as you spot someone being aggressive remind the group of the golden rules of the retrospective. Do it several times if needed. If it doesn’t work it might be useful to make feedback to this person after the meeting. Hopefully, this situation is very rare.—People pointing out someone’s responsibility 🫵Explanation: It can be a symptom of pressurised people or just a defence mechanism. It might also be due to a poor understanding of the retrospective objectives and rules or a lack of experience with this workshop.Possible solutions: same as above. You can also try to lead the group to focus on concrete actions that they might take, leading them to think about the future instead of dwelling on the past.—People wanting to share A LOT 🗣Explanation: Some people just like to speak a lot and share their points of view. It can also come from people who are not comfortable with silence. Most of the time they don’t even realise it. It also often comes from stakeholders or leaders who are eager to share their points of view.Possible solutions: You have to make sure that during the meeting everyone has the opportunity to speak and give their opinion about the different topics. You can for example remind the group that time flies and ask if other people have other opinions. Just make sure that opinions from people who speak the most are not over-represented in the retrospective summary shared with the company.After the workshopAs the retrospective’s animator, your role here is to summarise the learnings from the retrospective and share them with the company.Be careful with the granularity level. It’s important to have in mind that most people in the company haven’t worked on the project: don’t be too technical and try to present the content comprehensively. It doesn’t mean hiding information, it means having different levels of granularity in your document.The group decides what should be shared and what shouldn’t. If you want the retrospective to be a space of free speech and honesty you must agree with them about what should be shared and what should be kept within the group. Ask people for consent and feedback before sharing anything.The retrospective is only useful if actions are taken and a follow-up is done on regular basis. This responsibility is shared between the animator, the attendants and the manager.I hope this article will help you to organise better retrospectives or just guide you through your first one.

For product managers learning in public, understanding how to fail better is a crucial skill.Being a product manager is a bizarre profession — there’s no formal degree you can acquire first which means most of your learning is done on the job, in a hands-on way, and very much in the scariest format learning can be acquired in…In public.Being an exceptional product manager isn’t about avoiding failure — it’s about harnessing it to grow.The legendary Tony Fadell says this in his book, “Build: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making”:“To do great things, to really learn, you can’t shout suggestions from the rooftop then move on while someone else does the work. You have to get your hands dirty. You have to care about every step, lovingly craft every detail. You have to be there when it falls apart so you can put it back together.”So, how can you keep yourself together when you’re in the weeds, sleeves rolled up, all-in on what you’re building…and you fall apart?I did a deep dive into multiple domains to gather the best insights I could find and share with you, in addition to drawing on my own experiences as a product manager, athlete, business owner, and someone who has dealt with a whole lot of failures first-hand — building startups that failed, products that weren’t widely adopted, being benched after making bad plays, and dealing with debilitating health issues and injuries to name a few.What Psychology Can Teach UsA lot of the stigma around making mistakes comes from the thinking that failure is bad and that we should all strive for perfection. But perfection is an illusion. If we are human, we are not perfect and can never be, despite what society imparts on us.There’s also a difference between striving for perfection to improve and “being perfect”.Rather than thinking about how to be perfect, if we frame this to think about the ways in which we want to grow, specifically, and who we want to serve with our skills and abilities, it can take a lot of the weight off of making mistakes.It’s about becoming vs. being.We all know that growth requires some degree of struggle —we’ve been pounded with “no pain, no gain”, “leave your blood, sweat and tears on the floor”, and “win at all costs” mentalities since as far back as I can remember (I was born in the 80s). But it doesn’t have to be framed like this. I prefer to think of it as:Get really specific about what your North Star is and long-term desired outcomes (not just in the traditional way in writing down what you want to achieve, but who you want to be and how you want to feel and the impact you would like to have had).In what ways can you find the sweet spot right now, where you are growing in a strategic and focused way and making specific types of mistakes to learn? (Versus trying to do everything all at the same time and feeling overwhelmed not just by what’s on your plate but also the sheer number of mistakes you are bound to make if the leap you are trying to make is too great).If you were to jump into a strength training routine and try to bench press an exorbitant amount of weight right off the bat with no warm-up, coaching, or previous training, that’s a recipe for injury.Think about your career in the same way.“How can I progress and learn from my incremental mistakes intelligently?”What Sports Can Teach UsIn sports, an athlete’s ability to quickly bounce back after a mistake is a massive competitive advantage.When I was playing hockey, I was fortunate enough to play with a handful of the women’s Olympic team members at McGill University in Montreal. I learned something from them that stuck when it comes to flushing mistakes to move on quickly — after a bad shift, have a physical cue that you train to help you “let go” of the mistake you made so that you stop ruminating and make your next shift a great one. For me, this was firmly tapping my stick against the bench as soon as I got off the ice.For a linebacker, this might be pulling some grass and squeezing it and releasing it as a trigger to “let go”. For an elite CrossFit athlete, this might be journaling after an event to write down what didn’t go well, what they learned, and what they would do differently next time. For a baseball player, this might be a conscious cue to shift attention to playing good defence when they remove their batting glove after a bad at-bat.Find something that works for you and use it as your cue to “let the mistake go”.What Other Product Managers Can Teach UsInspired by Andrea Saez and Ricardo Blanch and many other aspiring and current product managers who have highlighted the fact that there is a severe lack of product failure stories that people speak about publicly, I recently posed the question, “What are some of the ways you’ve learned to respond better after making a mistake as a product manager?” on LinkedIn and Twitter. By far the top response was…OWN IT.Downplaying mistakes can not only erode trust — pretending they didn’t happen also means you miss out on learning. Both of these things can dramatically hinder your career and the ultimate impact you can have on the world.When you work with an interconnected team and your greatest strength as a product manager is not only in bringing solid product skills to the table, but also in your ability to build great relationships, owning your mistakes personally and publicly can dramatically help to build trust with your team members.Here are some of the responses I got:Making Mistakes With Conscious SupportThere are some schools of thought that encourage being thrown into the fire because it results in the best learning outcomes — it forces you to adapt or risk failing in gargantuan ways in order to survive.This was my early product management experience. Being thrown into the fire in my career has helped me grow exponentially — but it also came at a huge personal cost. My mental, physical, and emotional health suffered greatly.I now have much thicker skin, but I believe there’s a happy medium. Just like you wouldn’t throw an amateur cyclist directly into the Tour de France, working with a coach, joining a bootcamp program, or a Slack Group with others going through similar experiences or who have gone through them before can help you to set up appropriate guardrails, establish incremental objectives, and create a safe space to test limits with a more holistic approach in a supportive environment.What are some of the ways you’ve responded to mistakes and failure?Let me know in the comments below!-Lisa🧢P.S.

After all, an email is just a one-way flow of information waiting for a response. And as the data shows, most sales emails are simply ignored. However, email marketing is still an invaluable sales strategy.That’s why every sales manager should know how to use the power of email and how to write an effective follow-up message.Photo by Afif Ramdhasuma on UnsplashFollow-up email after a call — why is it so important?A follow-up letter should be an essential part of any sales process that involves talking to customers over the phone.But what exactly is it?There are two types of follow-up emails that are sent after a phone call. The first is an email sent to the potential client immediately after the call. In such a message, you should summarize the conversation, mention the next steps that you both have already agreed on, and set a time frame.The second type of follow-up email after a call should only be sent if your contact doesn’t reply to your first message or hasn’t contacted you for a long time after a brief first reply.Final thoughtAfter the call, it is important to send a follow-up email. Otherwise, a conversation with a potential client will turn into another chatter that will not bring any benefit and will not lead to sales.In simple words, it is guaranteed that without a follow-up message, your potential client will forget about your call. Even if you call them again later, your second conversation won’t have as much impact as the first.Do you believe in the power of follow-up emails?

So, our next point for discussion is how to deal with it. Experience allows people at professional studios to understand how much time it will take for a particular project and the possibility of some difficulties, or risks, which means understanding how much this work may actually cost in the end.4 Important Things Included in Product Design CostMore often, designers, studios or agencies revise their prices for services, depending on macro factors like the economic situation in the state, in the world, etc. The price may depend on several micro factors that affect directly or indirectly like you only need a design, from scratch or redesign, branding or rebranding, who is the customer, who is the designer, the urgency of the project, the amount of work, the time needed and so on. The product design cost will not be the same for the amount of work, different in complexity, deadlines or other. However, averagely, product design cost includes four important things. Here are they:1. Product DiscoveryProduct Discovery is a qualitative and quantitative product research, a deep research funnel. Discovery is an activity that helps determine if a product is needed in the market and why. Through continuous research, you observe an endless cycle of product development: you analyse data, find a problem, test ideas, get a result and learn a lesson. Since designers spend time for the reprocess. It should also be estimated.2. UX DesignUX / UI design is the design of convenient, understandable and aesthetic user interfaces. UX design particularly is responsible for the user experience of working with the application or website interface. UX design is not only about the beauty. It is all about an easy and intuitive user journey and high functionality.3. UI DesignWhen we pass over to the UI, UI design will rather be the design of buttons, application forms or input fields, which are all points of user interaction with the product you build. If UX is a mainly the process, then UI is a tool and it deserves a good investment.4. Usability TestingOf course, there’s no good product design without test. Usability testing should also be included into your estimation because a testing method establishes the degree of learnability, usability, comprehensibility, and attractiveness of the product for users in the context of given terms for the developed product.How much does Product Design Cost?So, the product design cost estimate price may vary from company to company because of various factors, and product design will cost differently from market to market. Here are some examples:Development companiesThe rates for full-service design plus engineering companies are similar to design agencies. Still, they will range from $100 USD up to $450 USD per hour, which also depends on who you hire, where they will be located, what market sectors they serve, and their also track record and the network they may leverage on your behalf.Design studiosMore prominent design companies and studious charge significantly more than freelancers. You’ll pay anywhere from $3,000 to $50,000+ to have a design company or agency design your logo or branding, create illustrations or anything.OtherFreelance designers, design firms, and agencies may charge anywhere from $5 to $100,000+ to create a high quality product design. For example, individual freelance designers may charge anywhere from $5 to $10,000+ to design a company logo, but it will be fully customized individual order, exclusively made as per the most sophisticated demands.Here’s also some gradation by region retrieved from Northell:Eastern EuropeAsiaLatin AmericaProduct Design Average TimelineThe clients can understand that the quality of the design depends on the time spent on it. And if the horizon of their expectations for the quality of design is comparable to expensive, famous studios, then you need to allocate twice, five times more time for the work of a designer. The design of any new product is quite a time-consuming process, especially if you want to have a great design. So, the average working timeline will also vary:Small ProjectFor example, it will take up to 6 months to create an actual new product or a start-up, yet in a category where the company already has some considerable experience. There may be tasks, when the performer does not have a clear idea or sample for work; they are evaluated individually by both the designer and the customer. This may be a new mobile device by an established smartphone company or similar. A totally new product released by a developing or start-up company will be designed in 9–12 months. Product discovery: 30–60 hours, UX design: 60–90 hours, UI design: 50–100 hours, Usability Testing: 40 hours.Middle-Sized ProjectMid-sized companies normally already have a clearly formulated product idea and a list of basic requirements. Product discovery: 60–120 hours, UX design: 120–200 hours, UI design: 110–220 hours, Usability Testing: 40–80 hours.Averagely, most full service design projects will take at least 6 months to complete all the phases, and often times longer depending on the scope of the project. If we take some middle sized project timeline, it may be as long as a year and a half including testing, fixing bugs and maintenance. It’s important to factor this into your desired completion date.Enterprise size ProjectConsequently, the design team that works with an enterprise-level project will take a lot more of time to explore a niche, search the market, conduct business analysis, create wireframes, then conduct testing, etc. In addition, the final product has an inalienable copyright, which also distinguishes it from serial, similar orders. It is for these reasons that, in addition to the complexity of the product and the competitiveness of the market, the author’s arbitrariness intervenes in the cost calculations. Product discovery: 120–240 hours, UX design: 200–500 hours, UI design: 400–600 hours, Usability Testing: 80 hours.How Much Time & Money Does It Take To Develop A New Product?So, to develop a new product from scratch, you will spend for the product development alone usually from $10,000 to over $10 million, but that figure may fluctuate quite a bit depending on the scale of the project and other factors. But for most cases, the range for launching a new product is somewhere between $20,000 and $500,000 averagely. However, the cost varies significantly depending on the industry, type of product, competition, and the goals you’re hoping to achieve, which are those other factors that should be estimated to prevent surprise expenses. By breaking down your expenses by each investment stage, you’ll be better prepared to fund your project without any significant loss.Key Factors That Affect the Final PriceMajor factors affecting price determination of product will be the following: 1. Project size, 2. Project complexity, 3, Tech stack, 4. Team level, and 5. Cooperation model.Project sizeProject size plays a vital role because it actually defines the final product cost and is the key for effective determining the product design price.Project complexityProject complexity unusually refers to the level of the product logic. Also, the complexity can be the design itself when a product needs to have some custom fonts, icons, images, or other sophisticated elements, etc. Since UX / UI linearly affect the usability of your product, don’t neglect the complexity issues while calculating the cost.Tech stackBusinesses that want to add advanced technology opportunities to the product should know that they will need extra money for the chosen technology stack. Extra features require improving brand identity, client loyalty, or other aspects of the business. The design cost will be cheaper in case you desire a standard product with a minimal set of features. And quite on the opposite when you pick a complex scalable project.LocationProduct design & development cost will also depend on the region where your contractor is located. Analysed by regions, countries in Eastern Europe are the most profitable option for hiring a design team. The IT community there speaks English, which fuels a thriving technology industry as there are no communication barriers, etc.Team levelThe more designers you hire have worked in their industry niche, the more they are valued, have needful experience and the higher the product design cost will be because if you need seniors then you pay up for their expertise. View the portfolio of recently completed projects, to find out how experienced the team is.Cooperation modelNormally design companies offer either fixed price or time & material (T&M) cooperation model to contract the client. Also, find out more on Fireart pricing models and IT outsourcing costs.For more project cost estimation details, read How to Estimate Software Development Cost.Why do you need a Product Design Team?The team that your chosen product design and development services may offer you will be your back up no matter what, especially if you are not keen on anything like design, technology or UX/UI, etc. in fact, an experienced team will help you with your project estimation too, they will provide both optimistic and pessimistic estimates and decide on the best way to deliver the project as per your requirements. To align the work utmost first:When ordering a design, try to determine how much time the designer needs for it.Calculate how much a chosen designer earns per month, per day.Multiply the number of days it takes to complete your order by the designer’s daily earnings.This is how you may get a general order value for each design piece like illustration, motion design or a logo, etc. This is an elementary formula of cost calculation that will give you an idea of how the costs are formed and then it will be easier for you to make head or tail of bigger scope estimations.Using a suitable form of payment, risks are minimized and good relations are built between the client and the designer. In the studio a fixed fee and a T&M models are used, but when hourly rate is appropriate, you may also count on that.Do not forget to discover more about CTO as a service.ConclusionBusiness experience allows people at professional studios like Fireart to understand how much time it will take for a particular project and the possibility of some difficulties, or risks, which means understanding how much this work may actually cost in the end. Many different factors may affect the end cost of the project. The key things that will influence the costs of your design will be project size, complexity, tech stack, team experience and the model they use for cooperation. Each project is unique, and the best option is always a custom design and development estimation approach.Project EstimationCostProduct ManagementProject ManagementDesign----More from BootcampFollowFrom idea to product, one lesson at a time.

On the other side, a focus on quality may result in a high standard product but may take longer to deliver.Speed to marketA startup that is trying to get a product to market as quickly as possible may prioritize speed over quality, while a company that is launching a product with a long shelf life may prioritize quality over speed.In product development, the length of time it takes to design and develop a new product can significantly impact a company’s speed to market.Companies that are able to get their products to market faster are better able to respond to changing market conditions and customer needs.After working in an enterprise tech giant and a mid-sized software company as a UX designer, here’s what I noticed in their different approaches to product development.1. Linear delivery (Waterfall)Before I left my job this year, I worked at a tech giant designing enterprise software. Some of my teammates had been around the industry almost as long as I’ve been alive.Our team followed a Waterfall approach to product development, which is a linear process. The Waterfall method includes stages such as:RequirementsDesignImplementationVerification or testingDeployment and maintenance(Source: Adobe — Waterfall Methodology: A Complete Guide)This process front-loads research and requirements gathering to fully understand the factors that could affect project completion, such as costs, assumptions, risk, dependencies, success metrics, and timelines.Disadvantages of WaterfallOne of the disadvantages to adopting this approach was that any delays in design or development ended up pushing back our release date.After all the MVP features had been built into the product, it finally shipped 6 months after the initial release date.Another disadvantage of Waterfall was the lack of customer involvement during the development process. Unlike Agile, there were no check-ins with clients for user feedback. Clients are often unsure about what exactly they want at the beginning of a project, which makes changes harder to accommodate down the road.2. Continuous delivery (Agile)After leaving my job, I joined a smaller SaaS company, which follows Agile methodology. I immediately noticed a sense of urgency to deliver.With Agile, the concept of continuous delivery can lead to faster time to market and greater efficiency in making changes, including implementing new features or bug fixes.Some of the differences I noticed with Agile include:working in milestones and sprints, short periods of time to complete a scoped out amount of workprioritizing tasks based on customer value and effortcontinuously conducting user research and testing to gather feedback and iterating on designsparticipating in Agile ceremonies, such as sprint planning, stand-ups, and retrospectives, to plan and track work, and reflect on team processesAfter working with both methodologies, Agile seems to value customer collaboration and responding to change over following a plan.In its nature, Agile allows teams to adapt to shifting priorities. There is an emphasis on getting things delivered quickly and continuously iterating on it based on customer feedback.Done is better than perfect, because perfect is never done.This made it possible for us to get our product in the hands of customers quickly and deploy updates frequently.Disadvantages of AgileHowever, when evaluating different design options, I’ve noticed that sometimes product management will just go with the quickest, easiest solution for development to implement.After all, just get it out the door and iterate after, right?Sometimes this approach makes sense when time and resources are limited. But I’ve encountered many situations where the quickest or easiest solution for development would potentially lead to more rework, or design debt. This creates a gap between the actual product experience and the desired one.(Source: Headway — Design Debt — Where It Comes From and How to Manage It)The risks of prioritizing speed over qualityJust as in dating, first impressions are key.Focusing solely on speedy delivery can lead to poor user experiences and negative first impressions. Customers often first experience a product through sales demoes and can be a determining factor in whether they end up purchasing.Another risk is accruing design debt, which leads to additional work down the road. This is caused by taking short-term action during the design and implementation phases and not focusing on the long-term vision.Design debt is all the good design concepts of solutions that you skipped in order to reach short-term goals. It’s all the corners you cut during or after the design stage, the moments when somebody said: “Forget it, let’s do it the simpler way, the users will make do.”— Ward CunninghamAccruing design debt doesn’t just impact the usability of the product; it forces your team to spend more time and resources on adjusting the designs later.A phased approach to product developmentWhen teams focus on speed instead of quality, they tend to take shortcuts in development. This can often be a result of lack of a shared long-term vision or aggressive deadlines to complete deliverables.Teams should balance speed with the quality of their solutions to deliver a product that is both functional and usable.A smarter business decision would be to envision a long-term solution, which can be scaled back and implemented in a phased approach.Identify the opportunity. Decide on a direction. Scale it back.Phase 1: Identify the opportunityGaining alignment amongst stakeholders is crucial to a project’s success.Start by defining the problem that your team is trying to solve for. This will help your team stay focused and ensure that you are working towards a solution that addresses the root cause of the problem.Some questions to consider when identifying opportunities include:What problem are we solving for?What are your target customer’s pain points or needs?What solutions are currently offered in the market and what are the gaps?What customer value do we want to achieve?What are our business objectives?Phase 2: Decide on a directionAfter identifying the opportunity, teams should diverge and explore different directions to align on a vision.Product, design, and development should work together to brainstorm a strategy that will meet customer needs and accelerate their business.Evaluate and prioritize the potential solutions based on feasibility, impact, and cost. This will help your team narrow down your approach and decide on a direction.Some questions to consider when deciding on a direction include:Does the solution address the problem?How feasible is the solution to implement?What is the potential impact of the solution on the customer and the business?What is the cost of implementing the solution?How does the solution compare to other potential solutions? What are the tradeoffs?What does success look like and how will we measure it?By aligning on a shared vision, design can make better informed decisions on how to bring it to reality.It also allows development to understand how to properly set up the back-end and build UI components in a way that will support further enhancements down the road.Phase 3: Scale it backGuided by your long-term vision, create an experience-based roadmap. This design thinking activity can help your team brainstorm ideas from the perspective of user outcomes. Break down the roadmap into stages, from short-term to long-term.Set realistic expectations for each stage so that teams don’t feel pressured to deliver something quick, which ultimately will lead you back to cutting corners in implementation.(Source: IBM Enterprise Design Thinking Toolkit)Reduce design debtWhen designing features, build scalability into your designs so that it can easily adapt to new requirements or enhancements in later stages. Consider all possible use cases for the feature within your product and across platforms if your company offers multiple products.Designers should also conduct regular desk checks and UI audits after design handoff to ensure features are implemented according to spec. Work closely with your developers to communicate interactions and user outcomes.By keeping a close eye on details during design and development phases, designers can help reduce the amount of design debt that gets built up.Key takeawaysProduct teams can learn an important lesson and shift away from the idea of “one big launch”.Waiting to perfect your product can be a huge mistake. Most likely, your competitors are working to release their product as soon as they can to take their share of the market.A well-defined vision can help teams overcome challenges during the product development process.When stakeholders are faced with constraints and unsure of how to proceed, alignment on the long-term vision can help them make better decisions that factor in cost, effort, and usability.By balancing speed and quality during implementation, teams can reduce the amount of design debt they accrue.

My father is a retired government employee who devoted his entire career to fisheries in southeast Asia and my mother has worked (still actively working) in the education sector all her life. So clearly, they aren’t really familiar with the IT sector. Plus, even now, agriculture is the main occupation in Nepal and technology related B to B services as well as B to C services are just slowly beginning to grow there.One time my father accidentally told that I was a “production manager” to his colleague. Another time when covid was at its peak and when I told them I had started working remotely, my mother inquired, “How can you work remotely? What do you do with a computer at home?” Being used to “showing up” at work for their entire life, needless to say, it was difficult to fathom what their daughter did without “going to work for real”.I haven’t had the time and opportunity to describe my work properly to my parents. The closest that I have come so far was making a comparison with the service that my mother was using in her school to record the student’s details such as examination scores, attendance and fees — that I am in a B to B SaaS industry.Not only do my parents, but also some of my friends who aren’t in the tech field sometimes ask me what I do. Since as a PM, I wear several hats and perform dozens of functions throughout a product’s lifecycle, it is sometimes difficult to explain what I do.So, I would like to use this opportunity to describe what one day at my work looks like as a product manager to my parents (and to my friends who were curious about what I was doing after getting a PhD in river ecology).The MorningsFor me, mornings are the most productive time. I drop off my daughter and start work around 8:15 AM. At EDOCODE, the start time varies from person to person. I start my day by checking slack messages, emails and customer inquiries.I begin the work that needs the most attention and concentration in the morning. This could includeCustomer successDepending on the day, we get a couple of inquiries from our customers. I try to reply to them right away and ask engineers if there are technical issues that need further following up. I communicate with them via emails, platforms like Intercom as well as phone calls to follow up. I sometimes get help from my Japanese colleagues to check my grammar and phrases.Data analysisI also analyze the data in Google analytics to see how our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are getting along.Preparing presentationsBased on the result from the data analysis, I prepare presentation documents for both internal meetings and external meetings. For external meetings, I always practice it first with some of my colleagues. They are kind and supportive enough to check the flow of the presentation and give me feedback.The slack messages start popping around 9:30 as more of our team members join. Our “attendance” channel also starts getting alerts where someone is running late because of their child’s doctor appointment; someone has a meeting elsewhere; someone is having a bad internet connection etc.The entire office meeting starts at 10:05 everyday in the morning. Everyday one of the members facilitates the meeting where we give quick updates about our business and have random chats about the latest news, our children, pets and hobbies. Ever since we started working remotely back in April 2021, this standup meeting serves as a vital place to come together to greet each other and start our day.After our daily stand ups, we have PUSHCODE team meetings(teams include PMs, engineers and designers) where we talk about our KPIs, tasks and progress. This meeting again serves as an essential platform for our cross functional team members to be on the same page. Since all of our team members at PUSHCODE are bilingual, we communicate in English.After the team meeting, I continue to do the tasks mentioned above and sometimes new tasks like the following get added after the team meeting.Task organizationWe have multiple projects running at the same time. To make sure I don’t forget to do it, I organize my tasks and as well as depending on the situation, assign the tasks to my co-workers.Preparing for upcoming meetings by setting up the agendaOur team tries to minimize the number of meetings to make sure we have enough focus time. But when we do have meetings, in order to make it effective, I prepare the agenda with the background information prior to the meeting.Lunch BreakI take my break around noon and enjoy my lunchtime either by reading (currently reading A Tale For the Time Being by Ruth Ozeki) or watching Netflix (currently watching Schitt’s Creek) and eating. On Tuesdays, we have a company paid lunch event called “lunchtime sessions” where one of us talks about light hearted topics. We have had fucked up sessions (where we talk about the times when we failed), debate competitions etc. in the past. There is another company paid lunch event called puff lunch where four of our colleagues are selected randomly on slack. We also have 「EDOCODEで賞」 once a month where we all write episodes when we were thankful at our colleagues.The AfternoonI usually have client meetings after lunch. Meeting with clients involves explaining about PUSHCODE, sharing the results of the AB test that we do for our clients and making proposals about the new AB tests. It is one of the opportunities where I hone my Japanese and presentation skills.Apart from talking to clients, my job also involves the following.Creating specification documentsTo create a specification document, a PM needs to have a clear idea of the current specs and the logic by which the program is written. So, my job includes understanding the current specification by communicating with designers and engineers and making sure what I specify can be created.Creating test specification documentsTest specification documents are used to test if the development done by engineers is based on the specification document. It is an exhaustive process where you need to think of all the possible cases and patterns that might occur including when your users are actually using the feature in real life.TestingAfter the engineers complete the development, I do the test and let them know the results so that they can fix it if there is anything to be fixed.Planning for the releaseAfter the test and fixing is done, it is also the job of a PM to plan for the release. Not only does it involve scheduling the date and time but also making sure to stay on top of the contents to be released, preparing and making release announcements to our customers and also working on areas that will get affected by the release (such as updating the documents, help center articles etc.)Adding help articles in the manualAt PUSHCODE, I also write manuals for our customers. If there is any new feature release, I make sure that there is a description of that in our manual so our customers can understand the details and use it effectively.Brainstorming about how to improve our product KPIs.Our team tries to be proactive about what we should build next by brainstorming on how to further improve our KPIs. We use tools like MIRO to ideate, prioritize and decide what to build next.You may have noticed that as a product manager, there is a lot of communicating, sharing, analyzing, documenting and decision making. Depending on who is involved, the communication is either in English or Japanese. I like that I get to use both languages at work. Since I am neither a native English nor a Japanese speaker, the fact that I get to use both languages is fun and important to me.Once in a while, we also have workshops and feedback sessions. Here is a glimpse of one of the workshops we had at EDOCODE this year. Feedback sessions are where we compliment our colleagues and let them know of any improvements they can make.The EveningI tend to reserve light work in the evenings but depending on the situation, I continue to do the work started in the afternoon. On Fridays, we have retrospective sessions where we talk about our week. After noting down the things I need to do for the next day, I stop my work around 5:30.Although I have described how the day goes like for the PM, everyday is different. The day in the life of a product manager is actually varied and is rarely dull. There are ample opportunities to build, measure and learn. Working as a PM for PUSHCODE is fun and rewarding regardless of the endless list of things to do.So if you think you can cope with the things I’ve described then jump aboard and join us as a product manager!EDOCODE is currently looking for engineers, designers, and product managers.If you are interested, please take a look at this recruitment page.Product ManagementCareersWorking In Japan----More from Anandeeta GurungFollowPassionate about reading, writing and product management.Love podcasts or audiobooks?

The art of talking to customers and the… | by Divjot Singh | Dec, 2022 | MediumDivjot SinghFollowDec 19·3 min readTalking to customersThe art of talking to customers and the perils of not doing it rightWhy talk to customers?Talking to users is a critical part of starting and running a successful company. It is important for founders and other key members of the company to maintain a direct connection with users in order to extract valuable information and feedback. This can help the company improve its product, marketing, and positioning.However, there are common mistakes that people make when conducting user interviews. These include talking about the product or idea, discussing hypotheticals, and asking leading questions.The PitfallsThere are several pitfalls that you should try to avoid when conducting user interviews:Asking leading questions: Leading questions are those that suggest a particular answer or try to steer the conversation in a certain direction. These types of questions can bias the user’s responses and make it harder to gather objective, unbiased data.Talking about your product or idea: It is important to avoid talking about your product or idea too much during a user interview. The goal is to gather information about the user’s needs and experiences, not to sell them on your product.Discussing hypotheticals: It can be tempting to ask users about hypothetical features or scenarios, but this can be misleading. It is better to focus on what users are actually doing and experiencing in their current situation, rather than asking them to speculate about what they might do in the future.Not listening actively: It is important to actively listen to the user’s responses and ask follow-up questions to clarify any points that are unclear or gather more information. Avoid interrupting the user or jumping to conclusions, and try to resist the temptation to steer the conversation in a particular direction.Failing to plan: It is important to have a clear plan in place for conducting user interviews, including a list of specific questions to ask and a goal for what information you hope to gather. Without a plan, it can be easy to wander off course or miss out on valuable data.To avoid these mistakes and get the most out of user interviews, it is important to focus on learning about the user’s life and specific problems they are facing, ask open-ended questions, and listen actively to the user’s responses. It is also helpful to have a clear plan in place for conducting user interviews, including a list of specific questions to ask and a goal for what information you hope to gather. By following these tips and maintaining a direct connection with users, founders and other key members of a company can ensure that they are constantly learning and adapting to better meet the needs of their customers.Open ended Questions“Tell me about a recent experience you had that relates to the problem our product is trying to solve. What was happening and how did you feel?”“Can you describe your current process for (related task)? What works well and what challenges do you face?”“How do you currently gather information or make decisions related to (related topic)? What factors do you consider?”“What are your long-term goals related to (related area)? How do you envision our product fitting into your plans?”“What do you wish you had more of or less of in your current solution for (related problem)? Why?”For exampleWhile talking to power Users of an EdTech product:Why do you love our app? — Wrong2. How do you use our app and when do you feel the need to use it? — Better3. What are your top 3 pain points regarding learning online? After the answer, ask — where does our product help you in your pain points? — BestBy asking open-ended questions like these, you can encourage the user to share detailed, specific information about their experiences and needs. This can help you better understand the problem you are trying to solve and identify areas where your product can be improved.Suggested Resources:The Mom TestEric Migicovsky — How to Talk to Users — YouTubeProduct ManagementProduct ManagerCustomer Experience----More from Divjot SinghFollowEd-tech.

There are lots of different… | by Frank Schillinger | devlix Blog | Dec, 2022 | MediumPublished indevlix BlogFrank SchillingerFollowDec 20·10 min readCreative BrainstormingPhoto by Brands&People on UnsplashThere are lots of different brainstorming methods out there, but which one is best for you and your team? Whether you’re a solopreneur or part of a team, one of these methods will help you come up with great ideas!Coming up with good ideas is one of the hardest and most creative tasks you can face. However, you don’t have to be “creative” to do this. Motivation is key — without it, even the best-organized brainstorming session won’t generate good ideas. Create a relaxed atmosphere and give enough time and space for the session.Techniques for your next sessionSince hardly any people succeed in brainstorming or finding ideas without a setting, techniques have been developed that aim to guide this creative process in an organized pattern using defined procedures and rules. The success of these techniques proves them right.So let’s take a look at a few techniques that you can try out yourself or with your team.Mind mappingA popular brainstorming technique that can be used by individuals or groups is mind mapping. To create a mind map, you start with a central idea in the middle of a sheet of paper and then draw branches from the center. Each branch represents a different aspect of the central idea, and you can add as many details as you like. This technique is especially helpful when relationships are important and details need to be worked out. There are also plenty of digital tools for creating mind maps.Mind maps are easy to understand, they organize your ideas and thoughts and are a good way to document them.Example: We start with a concrete product idea and note down significant features that are essential for the customer acceptance. We now take a closer look at each feature and note down the individual functions that a feature must or should consist of. In a further step, we can even add further information to each feature, e.g., attributes, behavior, images, diagrams, etc.Example of a Mind mapIn a group, it is essential that discussions be given enough space and that everyone is asked for his or her opinion or idea. It easily happens that primarily the “loudest” person brings in his or her ideas, and other opinions are lost.More information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_mapBrainwritingThis technique can also be used solo or in a group. Unlike in mind mapping, each person is forced to write down their ideas. So, everyone impacts the outcome.You start by having each person write down a new idea on a piece of paper. Then all the pieces of paper are collected and shuffled. Each person takes a piece of paper and expands the idea written on it. This process is continued until each person has complemented all the ideas of the other participants. This technique is excellent for quickly generating and developing many ideas.Example of a Brainwriting processMore information on the 6–3–5 variant: https://www.toolshero.com/creativity/brainwriting/SCAMPERSCAMPER stands forSubstitute,Combine,Adapt,Modify,Put to other uses,Eliminate andReverse/Rearrange.In this method, you take an existing product or service and think about how you could improve it using the SCAMPER framework. First, get a good picture of the product because you should be familiar with its features, functions and unique aspects before you start thinking about possible improvements.Then go through the following checklist and write down at least one sentence or keyword for each bullet point.Substitute: Can you exchange components, e.g., parts, modules, materials, people, applications, and steps in the process?Combine: Are there features or services that you can merge/combine?Adapt: Are there similar features and solutions in a different context? Can they be used and adapted?Modify: Can a feature, function, haptic, taste or similar be changed? Can the value of the product or service be increased?Put to other uses: Can the product be used in other ways? How would people use the product who are not part of the current target group? Can the target group be expanded?Eliminate: Is there potential for simplification? Can functions or features be removed, downsized, split up without reducing the value? What might even be unnecessary?Reverse: Can the product be used for something contrary without losing value?This technique is especially useful for developing new product ideas from existing products or to improve them. As you can see, the list forces you to answer fundamental questions.The technique is also suitable for groups to get more ideas and inspiration from different points of view. Furthermore, it is certainly interesting to have these questions answered by direct customers of the product you are looking at.More information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCAMPERRapid IdeationRapid Ideation is a brainstorming technique that can be used by individuals or groups and promises many ideas generated in a short time. There are various forms of this technique, which we will not discuss here. In the most simple variant, all participants write their ideas individually on Post-its within 3 to 5 minutes and then stick them on a wall or another surface for working. Each idea is introduced shortly by the author, and short questions are answered directly.Photo by Brands&People on UnsplashIt is important to note that this is not a direct evaluation of ideas. Quantity is more essential than quality in this technique. So collect as many ideas on different aspects as possible.Afterwards, an evaluation can take place. In the simplest case, this is done by “dot voting”, in which each participant gives his or her vote or one point to the ideas. Now would also be the time for a discussion on different ideas. This technique is excellent for overcoming creative blockades.More information: https://www.thinkfwd.co/toolkit/rapid-ideationReverse BrainstormingThere are always situations in which an idea simply does not want to succeed with the techniques described here. Then Reverse Brainstorming is a helpful tool to overcome this blockade! Instead of finding ideas to improve products, we think about how we can make known or non-existent problems of a product worse or cause them. This may sound counterproductive, but this approach actually brings aspects to light on closer inspection that are otherwise rarely considered. If we reverse the ideas about making things worse, we often get measures that can improve the product.Examples of questions we can ask ourselves:Identify risks: How or why might the product or a feature fail for the customer?For known issues: How might we worsen and foster the issue? What underlying conditions could make the issue worse?Product strategy: What negative aspects might the market bring to our product? Why might sales of our product drop off?Identify potentials: How might processes become slower and more expensive? How can we prevent our product from becoming more popular?It is irrelevant, whether you first write down answers on Post-its and then stick them on the wall, or whether you discuss questions together and agree on an answer. Important is, that the answers are then reversed — in other words, we look at the opposite statement and evaluate whether it could be useful as an idea for improvement. This means if we have identified the stopping of all marketing activities as worsening the current situation, strengthening these activities is very likely to bring about an improvement.More information: https://online.visual-paradigm.com/knowledge/brainstorming/what-is-reverse-brainstorming/Round RobinThis technique is slightly similar to the Brainwriting technique, but in contrast, it does not rely on the continued development of an idea. Rather, ideas are used as triggers for new ideas.Ideally, a group of people sits in a circle or around a table. Each person now writes down an idea, e.g., on how to solve a known problem. Once each person has done this, the ideas just noted down are passed on to the person sitting next to them. This person can now use them as inspiration and in turn develop a new idea from them. This is again passed on to the next person.This is repeated until you feel you have collected enough ideas. Duplicates are then sorted out, and the remaining ideas are discussed and explained in more detail.More information: https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/round-robin-brainstorming.htmStepladderStepladder brainstorming is a good technique to prevent the problem of the “loudest” or to better engage introverted people into discussion. After the topic of the brainstorming session is explained, all but two people leave the room.The people who are now no longer in the room use the time to come up with one or more ideas for the topic. To involve many perspectives on the topic, each person should do this on their own.The two people present in the room now discuss their ideas and then call one person back into the room, who in turn presents and explains his or her ideas. Afterwards, the people who were already in the room present their ideas and, in the best case, a discussion with new views follows.This is repeated until all the people of the group are back in the room and have presented their ideas. A group discussion is then encouraged, which should have the goal of developing these ideas.More information: https://online.visual-paradigm.com/knowledge/brainstorming/what-is-stepladder-technique/Five Why’sConstantly asking “why” is strongly reminiscent of the childlike tactic of trying to understand the world. At the same time, it is one of the simplest and most effective techniques on how to understand problems.Photo by Evan Dennis on UnsplashOne person expresses a problem and another person asks the simple question, “Why or for what reason is this the case?” The person who expressed the problem then answers the question, thereby concretizing the actual problem. This is repeated until the core of the issue is identified. “Five” is considered to be a benchmark here. Sometimes problems are explored after only two questions, or they require more than five rounds of concretization.This technique can happen in groups of 2 and is very effective. However, more people can be involved on the Q&A if it helps to solve the problem.More information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whysCrazy EightAnother technique aimed at finding ideas quickly are the “Crazy Eight”.All participants grab a sheet of paper and a pen and divide the sheet into eight areas, which are then worked on one after the other. Now a timer is set and participants have one (1) minute to visualize an initial idea on a previously presented topic. “Visualize” here means just that: draw your idea and use words if you can’t visualize them (but only then). This process is repeated until all eight fields are filled.Photo by Alex Lion on UnsplashThe time restriction forces participants to not get lost in thought streams too much and encourages them to be spontaneous. It may take some practice to get comfortable with this format. However, very unconventional ideas often come up for discussion this way!The most important rule here: There are no bad ideas!Finally, each participant presents his or her ideas and answers feedback questions. You should make sure that ideas are not discussed down to the smallest detail. Afterwards, a dot-voting can be used, for example, in which each participant votes for his or her favorite(s) with a sticky dot or similar.More information: https://conceptboard.com/blog/crazy-8s-brainstorming-template/Six Thinking HatsEven if you can use this technique alone, it’s really fun in a group. Brainstorming and problem-solving become more efficient if you consider different perspectives and aspects.Start by explaining the topic, problem, etc. that you want to brainstorm about. Now assign the roles. Of course, they do not have to be hats, which have to serve as a symbol for different roles. Alternatively, you can use place cards, badges, stickers, etc. You yourself should take the blue role at the beginning. The roles will be taken by the individuals in further explanation. However, there is nothing wrong with groups of 2 or more people taking on the roles.Photo by JOSHUA COLEMAN on UnsplashWhite hat: This person represents the objective analyst in the round, who always takes a neutral standpoint and trusts data, figures, and factsRed hat: Good ideas are often based on emotions — therefore this person brings in fears, hopes, opinions, and feelings into the discussionBlack hat: Doomsayers are exceptionally welcome — they focus on risks, problems, express concerns and fears and thus personify the critical skepticYellow hat: Of course, the optimist cannot be missing, who is always focused on the positive aspects and brings into play opportunities, advantages, and benefitsGreen hat: In a creative process, the creative person cannot be absent, who with his thought-provoking ideas, alternatives, and impulses perhaps also takes unconventional directionsBlue hat: This organizational talent brings structure to the table and safeguards the actual creative process, keeping it and the big picture in viewNow start the discussion in turn and explain your thoughts, ideas, suggestions, etc. according to your role. Record this information on a flip chart, wall, or paper.Once each participant has expressed their thoughts according to their role, the roles change and so do the perspectives of each person. So pass the “hat” and accept the new role you are given. The discussion round now starts again. Once the roles have been changed all the way through, a group discussion can be initiated or the collected aspects can be reviewed.More information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_HatsTry it out!These techniques are excellent methods for brainstorming and problem-solving — but not the only ones. A search on the web will give you insight into plenty of other techniques and possibilities. Use them to overcome creative blockades, involve all members of your team, and come up with a variety of ideas in a short amount of time. Try them out!

Even though I am already taking my 3 months Bootcamp at Binar Academy before, it is still quite a challenge in taking a PM role in an organization that does not have any best practices yet in the field of PM. Yes, the Product Management field in my workplace is quite a new thing. There is only 1 PM beside me, and we only started a year ago.Moving on, as a wise man said, there is always a lesson that can be learned in any kind of situation, depending on how we see them, and how we receive them. There are 5 things that I learned in my early PM career that I think might also help you in your early PM journey. Please bear in mind that this lesson could and couldn’t apply to your situation as I am still learning at this point. Without further ado, let’s go to the main course.1 — No matter what kind of product we manage, the user (and our team) are undoubtedly, still human.“What makes your product great is not only the product itself but the feeling and the experience from the user when they are getting the proposed value when using the product”Never forget! Easy to say, harder to do. Sometimes, somehow, when the first time we are assigned to a new role, we want to make a remarkable achievement in the shortest period that we could get. In terms of Product Manager, what you manage, is obviously, a product(s).These (cool) terms can make people think that they have to make the product to be the best product (or at least a better one). This mindset makes some people (including me of course) sometimes forget that what makes the product great is not only the product itself but the feeling and the experience from the user when they are getting the proposed value when using the product.If we (all the team) understand this essence, it will make a drastic change in how we do our work (PM works in my case). The change is: we will shift our energy not to the product, but to the human, the people around the product. The user, and of course, the value provider team. And guess what is one of the best ways to understand a human being? Communicate with each other.What I did in my first month as PM, is I allocated my time to talk to each of the team and the key users. This makes me understand how things are done, what are things already good, what kind of improvement we need to do, and what kind of direction we want to go. It also makes bonding time much faster. However, what I lacked is the bravery and the boldness to take immediate and early decisions related to the ways of working that really need to be improved (this lesson will be detailed in the fifth point).2 — Not everyone can work with detailed work. However, with the devil in the details, be the devil with having passion.“Do you ever known a person that cannot remember well about their paperwork, but can describe amazingly accurately every modification that they do in their car? That is one of the examples where passion can make us improve a lot, including in our attention to detail”Working as a PM required a high level of detailed work. However, not everybody can work well with a lot of detailed work. If you are familiar with MBTI personality, then you already know that not every MBTI type could have a high level of attention to detail.However, there will (always) be a problem occurring in the future if a PM doesn’t have enough attention to detail. So, does it mean people with less than enough level of attention to detail cannot work well as PMs?Fear not, the answer is both yes and no. It will be yes if the PM is not having enough passion in the field of PM and in the product itself. The answer will be no with the vice versa reason. Why?When a person has enough passion for what they do, the ability of attention to detail will naturally be improved. Do you ever know a person that cannot remember well about their paperwork, but can describe amazingly accurately every modification that they do in their car? That is one of the examples where passion can make us improve a lot, including in our attention to detail. It happens because if we are having enough passion for what we do, we are willing to explore and do any kind of work, no matter how big or small the work is, we will do it happily, and will never forget even the smallest details of their work.Therefore, if you are not the kind of person with a high level of attention to detail, then be passionate! It will help you a lot.3 — Explore everything in your free time! There is always, always something to learn if we are having the intention to learn“No matter what we do, if we are having an intention of learning, we are in the process of learning something.”I think this is the most obvious thing, but I like to include this lesson within all of these points because I have a unique perspective on this one.If we heard the term “learn”, then most of us will imagine a scene where we are reading a book, practising, or doing any kind of on-desk learning activity that of course there is no fun in that. However, learning and not learning, is just a matter of “intention”. No matter what we do, if we are having an intention of learning, we are in the process of learning something. You can mention anything, scrolling Tiktok? Playing games? Travelling? Again, as long as we are having an intention of learning, then we are in the process of learning.It can be described by the fact that our brain will start looking at something more frequently if we are having the intention to do the things that we want to achieve. If we are commuting from our home to our office with the intention of learning how people act and behave in the station, then we will learn it. If we are scrolling Tiktok with the intention of learning how the transition works in viral content, then we are learning about it. So, we have to set our minds before doing anything. Set our mind to learn, and then we will always learn anything, anytime, anywhere, from anybody.How does this lesson affect our work as PMs? Within the span of 200 days as PM, there is one unique thing that I realize. Product managers need to have a certain amount of creativity, and creativity can be trained by improving our ability to connect between dots and improve the number of dots that we have. Exploring everything, and learning anything that we do, can help us to improve the number of dots that we have. And trust me, you will be amazed at how one of the unique ideas comes from the most unexpected learning activity.4 — Learn how much freedom you have, and utilize it with the people around you“However, no matter in which stage your product team is, there will always be a certain degree of freedom that you could have. This level of freedom can only be felt if we are consciously learn about the freedom itself.”As new PMs, the first thing that we have to do is to learn how things are done within our team or organization. However, if we are lucky enough, we will get into the early stage of the product team that not having the best practices and formal ways of working. I am saying that this is the “lucky” moment because, in this situation, PM can learn and experience so many things with trying to find the best practice ways of working in the team.On the other hand, if we are getting into a mature stage of the product team, we are also lucky enough, then be able to learn the best practice of PM ways of working within the organization. The real challenges lie in the middle.However, no matter in which stage your product team is, there will always be a certain degree of freedom that you could have. This level of freedom can only be felt if we are consciously learn about the freedom itself. This degree of freedom is never felt by PMs that only work by following the existing ways of working. Once we know how much freedom that we have, it will help us tremendously in improving the product team’s ways of working. It will help us do some experiments without crossing the line. Remember, there is no elixir available in this world, nothing will really work 100% in any kind of situation, anywhere.5 — Know your weaknesses, be bold in taking decisions, and admit your mistakes“We can always show our confusion, misunderstanding, and uncertainty when we are having the brainstorming and discussion sessions, but always be bold when taking decisions. “This is the last lesson learned that I want to share and I want to make it really quick. Not everyone will expect you to be perfect and know everything. But everyone will expect you to have a clear direction of where the product will go. In order to meet this expectation, we have to know exactly what our weaknesses are. Since we will never be able to do PM work without anyone’s help and contribution and to make all the contributions fit the product vision, we need to understand our weaknesses.Furthermore, be bold in taking decisions. We can always show our confusion, misunderstanding, and uncertainty when we are having brainstorming and discussion sessions, but always be bold when taking decisions. However, as we are human, we will never be perfect without any mistakes. And when that moment appeared, the mistakes caused by us, be gentle and admit the mistakes. Own the mistakes, just like how we own the product roadmap. This behaviour will strengthen the bond and trust with the team.FinaleIt is not perfect, and not everything shared here will also be true. However, I hope this lesson that I shared could help you even at the smallest point in your career, and I hope the best for all of you. Let’s start the best PM journey that we could have!A quote to end the article.

Make sure you understand what the company is looking for in a product manager and how your skills and experience align with those requirements.Research the company and its products. Familiarize yourself with the company’s products and how they fit into the market. This will help you understand the company’s goals and challenges and allow you to speak intelligently about them in the interview.Practice case studies and problem-solving questions. Many product management interviews will involve case studies or problem-solving questions. Practice these types of questions beforehand to improve your ability to think on your feet and articulate your thought process.Brush up on your product management skills and knowledge. Review key concepts and techniques, such as agile development, user research, and product roadmap creation.Prepare for behavioral questions. Many product management interviews will include behavioral questions that ask about your past experiences and how you handle certain situations. Think about specific examples from your previous work or education that demonstrate your skills and abilities.Practice your communication skills. Product managers need to be able to communicate effectively with a variety of stakeholders, including developers, designers, executives, and customers. Practice explaining technical concepts in a clear and concise way, and be prepared to present your ideas persuasively.Dress appropriately and arrive on time. Make a good impression by dressing appropriately for the interview and arriving on time.Interviewing for a product manager role at a MAANG (Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) company is likely to be a competitive and challenging process.These companies are known for their rigorous hiring standards and high-quality product management teams.During the interview process, you can expect to be asked a range of questions, including technical questions about your knowledge of product management concepts and techniques, as well as behavioral questions that ask about your past experiences and how you handle certain situations.To prepare for behavioral questions, it’s a good idea to think about specific examples from your previous work or education that demonstrate your skills and abilities. Some common behavioral questions that may be asked in a product manager interview include:Tell me about a time when you had to balance competing priorities and how you handled it.Describe a situation where you had to persuade others to adopt your point of view.How do you handle conflict or disagreement on a team?Give an example of a time when you took a risk and it paid off.Describe a situation where you had to adapt to change or pivot your strategy.When answering behavioral questions, it’s important to use the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) format to clearly articulate your thought process and the outcomes of your actions. This will help the interviewer understand how you approach problems and make decisions.FAANG companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) are known for their rigorous and competitive interview processes, and product manager interviews are no exception.Some common types of questions that you may encounter in a product manager interview at a FAANG company include:Strategy questions: These questions test your ability to think strategically about product development and how to prioritize competing goals and objectives. Examples include “How would you prioritize features for a new product?” and “How would you go about launching a new product in a competitive market?”Analytical questions: These questions test your ability to analyze data and make data-driven decisions. Examples include “How would you use data to inform product decisions?” and “How do you measure the success of a product?”Problem-solving questions: These questions test your ability to identify and solve complex problems. Examples include “How would you approach a situation where the product is not meeting customer needs?” and “How do you go about identifying and fixing product defects?”Behavioral questions: These questions ask about your past experiences and how you have handled specific situations in the past. Examples include “Tell me about a time when you had to make a tough decision as a product manager” and “How have you dealt with conflicts or disagreements with team members or stakeholders in the past?”Technical questions: Depending on the role, you may also be asked technical questions related to the specific product or industry. These questions could test your knowledge of specific technologies, algorithms, or industry best practices.Overall, it is important to be prepared to demonstrate your strategic thinking, analytical skills, problem-solving abilities, and communication skills in a product manager interview at a FAANG company.In addition to preparing for specific questions, it’s also important to be familiar with the company’s products and culture, as well as the specific role you are applying for.Researching the company and its products, as well as practicing case studies and problem-solving questions, can help you be more confident and prepared for the interview.Photo by Christina Morillo: https://www.pexels.com/photo/two-woman-in-black-sits-on-chair-near-table-1181605/Case study rounds are a common part of the product manager interview process at MAANG (Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) companies. These types of interviews are designed to test your problem-solving skills and ability to think on your feet.To approach answering case study questions in a product manager interview, there are a few key steps you can follow:Understand the problem: Take the time to fully understand the problem or challenge presented in the case study. Ask clarifying questions if necessary to ensure you have all the information you need.Break down the problem: Identify the key elements of the problem and break them down into smaller, more manageable pieces. This will help you better understand the underlying issues and come up with a more targeted solution.Develop a plan: Based on your understanding of the problem, come up with a plan to address it. This might include identifying key stakeholders, gathering data, or developing a prototype.Communicate your plan: Clearly articulate your plan to the interviewer, explaining your reasoning and how it addresses the problem presented in the case study. Be prepared to answer questions and make adjustments to your plan as needed.Consider potential risks and challenges: Think about potential risks or challenges that could arise as you implement your plan and be prepared to discuss how you would address them.It’s important to approach case study questions in a structured and logical way, and to be able to clearly communicate your thought process and solutions to the interviewer. Practice is key, so consider working through sample case study questions beforehand to improve your problem-solving skills.Product ManagerProduct ManagementTech InterviewInterview PreparationPm Interview----More from BootcampFollowFrom idea to product, one lesson at a time.

I’m sitting in my condo in Canada’s most French province about to embark on a brand-new adventure.ChatGPT and MidJourney are currently all over the internet. It seems that everyone is scrambling to understand these new technologies. Debates are happening as programmers debate whether or not AI will replace human intelligence. Is this the end of software developers? Will Product Managers sit in a room and explain requirements to a machine that will produce the next generation of applications and tools?The answer is no…but also yes. The cold, hard truth as I see it, is that human intelligence has become less special. Artists, programmers, writers, tutors, content creators, and the countless other professions that thought themselves safe have all been put on notice. Human intelligence for the first time in any of our lifetimes has missed a step.I can tell you that the product of the human mind is no longer special. We are all in trouble and the people telling you not to worry are either idiots or liars. We are in trouble.That brings us to this blog. As a product manager, it is perfectly obvious to me that in 2 years, these software techniques will become industry standard. So I’m getting in on the ground floor.The project parameters:Use Chat GPT, GitHub Co-Pilot and MidJourney absolutely shamelessly to get an online resume-building startup off the ground by the end of 2023.I will be documenting the entire process right here with you on Medium.

It is a tool that can help identify and clarify opportunities to make a social, environmental, or any type of impact that you care about. They also help evaluate the potential impact of different interventions or solutions.To create an Impact Opportunity Outline, there are 5 questions that need to be answered and documented:What system are you trying to impact?The first step in creating an Impact Opportunity Outline is to identify the specific system that you want to make a positive impact on. This might be a social, environmental, or economic system, or a combination of these. It is important to be specific about the system you are trying to impact, as this will help you understand the challenges and opportunities that exist within it.How does the system work today?Once you have identified the system you want to impact, you need to understand how it currently works. This might involve researching the existing structure, policies, products, and processes that shape the system, as well as the key actors and stakeholders involved. This usually involves diagramming the relationships of all parts of the system together. Understanding how the system currently operates will help you identify areas where you can make a difference.What change in behavior do you want to influence?To create a meaningful impact, you need to identify the specific behaviors that you want to influence within the system. This might involve encouraging people to adopt certain habits or practices, changing the way organizations or institutions operate, or even getting rid of parts of the current system. It is important to be clear about the specific behaviors that you want to change, as this will guide the design of your intervention to be targeted and effective.Where in the system could you intervene?Once you have identified the behaviors you want to influence, you need to identify the most effective points of intervention within the system. This might involve targeting specific organizations or individuals, or making changes to policies or practices at a broader level. It is important to think about where you can have the greatest impact, and to consider the resources and capacity that you have available to you.What would the intervention need to accomplish to be successful?Finally, you need to identify the specific goals and outcomes that you want to achieve with your intervention. This might involve increasing the adoption of a particular habit or practice, changing the way an organization operates, or improving outcomes for a specific group of people. It is important to be clear about your goals and to think about how you will measure success, as this will help you design an effective intervention and track your progress over time.All in all, by answering these five questions, you can create an Impact Opportunity Outline that outlines the potential for your project or initiative to make a positive impact on a particular system. This document can be used to guide your efforts and help you focus your resources on the most impactful interventions.DesignProduct ManagementUXCreativityIdeas----More from BootcampFollowFrom idea to product, one lesson at a time.

Meaning that brands have to adjust their branding, communication, pre and post-sales techniques, product experience and interface, service and more according to what their customers demand.The era of positioning your brand above the consumer on a vertical order is over. Your target audience will tell you how this works from now on.For instance, on Instagram you had to have a public figure profile to have a voice and influence an audience. TikTok changed that and now people don’t have to be a celebrity to have a voice and influence their followers regarding their opinion on products and services. And with that in mind, all businesses know that delivering the best customer experience for everyone is a top priority.Also nowadays, customer experience should also be as personalized as it can be. And that will remain important in 2023.As a startup or SME (small or medium sized company), there are many low cost platforms that assist you in delivering a great customer experience. But few platforms enable you to deliver a personalized one.As a Marketing Agency, for instance, you have many platforms that enable you to manage and share information among your colleagues. Like Google Drive or Dropbox. But as a Marketing Agency, you have to share documents and presentations with your clients. Usually, your team will share the restricted link from Google Drive to that PowerPoint via email, or schedule a “quick follow up meeting” to present the project and send them the PDF file afterwards.Now, how do you shorten this journey to make it more practical and efficient for you and your clients? And especially, how do you personalize this experience?With that journey in mind, we created Prodflow.Prodflow is a software that this Marketing Agency (that could also be a Media Production company, or Real Estate) will use to share the projects’ results with their clients, or partners and other stakeholders.Within the software, the Marketing Agency will customize it with their own logo and colors, so their clients feel like working at their own digital workspace where they can see the projects’ performance at any time through the Prodflow App.In there, the Marketing Agency team will upload all the presentations, images, videos, designs, spreadsheets and other business information per project and per client. So your client will enter the App and check every result on the project at any time, tracking its performance and sharing their thoughts and feedback with the Agency team.There is no need to send the link to the projects’ file whenever your team updates new information, or schedule a meeting to talk about a change in the banner design. You can share it via Prodflow App and your client can check it in real time and give their feedback so you can discuss it right there.That way, you have one platform that enables you to provide a personalized experience, share projects with your clients or partners in real time, gather feedback and discuss its performance so you can leave Google Drive and Meetings for internal operations and more strategic matters, respectively.And since we are talking about startups and SMEs, all of that happens at a low cost, since the platform was designed to make growing businesses work in a easier, faster and not expensive way — which is always ideal.Hi :)This is the official Medium account for the team behind Prodflow.

It is also a valuable resource for the technology business as a whole because it provides a clear, high-level view of the company’s direction and helps to align the efforts of various teams and stakeholders.Here are a few specific reasons why a product roadmap is important for a product manager and a technology business:Setting expectations: A product roadmap sets clear expectations for what the product will achieve and when those goals will be reached. This helps to ensure that everyone is working towards the same objectives and that resources are allocated appropriately.Prioritizing features: A product roadmap helps a product manager prioritize features and determine which ones should be implemented first based on their value to the business and the customers.Aligning teams: A product roadmap helps to align the efforts of various teams within a technology business, such as engineering, marketing, and sales, by providing a shared understanding of the product’s goals and direction.Communicating with stakeholders: A product roadmap is a valuable communication tool that can be shared with a wide range of stakeholders, including customers, investors, and senior management. It helps to ensure that everyone is aware of the product’s progress and priorities.Adapting to change: A product roadmap is not a static document, and it should be regularly updated and refined as the product and market evolve. This flexibility helps the product manager and the technology business to respond to changes and take advantage of new opportunities.Define your product vision: This involves understanding what problem your product is trying to solve, and the overall goals you want to achieve with the product.Defining the product vision as a product manager in a tech company involves understanding the problem that your product is trying to solve, and the overall goals you want to achieve with the product.

Identify your target market: Knowing your target market is crucial for determining the features and functionality of your product.3. Conduct a SWOT analysis: A SWOT analysis helps you identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats associated with your product.A SWOT analysis is a strategic planning tool that helps you identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats associated with your product. As a product manager, you can use a SWOT analysis to understand your product’s competitive landscape and identify potential areas for improvement.Here are the steps to conduct a SWOT analysis for your product:Identify your product’s strengths: Think about what makes your product unique and valuable to your customers. Consider factors such as its features, functionality, performance, and reputation.Identify your product’s weaknesses: Consider any limitations or areas for improvement in your product, including any technical issues or customer complaints.Identify opportunities for your product: Look for external factors that could be advantageous for your product, such as new market trends or untapped customer segments.Identify threats to your product: Consider external factors that could be detrimental to your product, such as new competitors or changes in market conditions.Analyze the results of your SWOT analysis: Use the information gathered during the SWOT analysis to identify potential areas for improvement in your product and develop strategies to address any weaknesses or threats.Use the SWOT analysis to inform your product roadmap: Incorporate the insights from your SWOT analysis into your product roadmap to ensure that you are addressing the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats identified during the analysis.Review and update the SWOT analysis regularly: As your product and market conditions evolve, it’s important to review and update your SWOT analysis regularly to ensure it remains relevant and accurate.4. Define your product roadmap: A product roadmap is a high-level overview of the plan for your product, including the key features and milestones you want to achieve.5. Break down the roadmap into smaller, actionable steps: Once you have a roadmap in place, it’s important to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces so you can make progress on your product development.6. Prioritize your roadmap: Not all features and milestones on your roadmap will be equally important. Prioritize the items on your roadmap based on their potential impact and the resources required to complete them.7.

Monitor progress and adjust as needed: As you work on your product, it’s important to keep an eye on progress and be prepared to make adjustments to your roadmap as needed.9. Engage with customers and stakeholders: It’s important to get feedback from customers and stakeholders throughout the product development process. This can help you ensure that you are building a product that meets the needs and expectations of your target market.10.

CTO services may help Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) to self-assess their digital potential and access market-proven and cost-effective digital solutions at any time from anywhere as per their readiness and needs. This service will be ideal if you need to hire a CTO for a limited time.What is CTO as a Service?CaaS (CTO as a service) means technical director as a service, a top technology executive. This is a brand new way of cooperation with the CTO. When the company or a startup hires an external specialist to solve their technical problems, it may help them with development and solving the issues in their local technical team, enable bringing their most ambitious and bold ideas to life, oversee the entire information technology department. CTO is also responsible for integrating business requirements and needs into IT planning and operations.Types of CTO servicesOne of the new trends in this area is the CaaS service that allows hiring people to solve technical issues, and simplify and streamline the company’s business processes. Let’s figure out what types of cto services can be used in various models.Full-time internal CTO servicesThe job of a full-time internal CTO is to keep track of how a business is performing and what else could be done to improve the performance better to attract more customers, partners, and clients. So, full-time, internal CTO services include technical and business support regularly as if from an in house specialist.Full-time offshore servicesOutsource CTO may easily help to identify risks in such issues as company cybersecurity systems vulnerabilities or assist ensuring that your company’s services and products are up to required standards, etc. To supervise these and more issues, you may easily hire cto as a service offshore.Part-time offshore or Fractional CTO servicesThere is also an option to hire Fractional CTO services which often may be called a Virtual CTO. This is a specialist who manages technology for a company for a certain fraction of time, on the projects fraction or for a fraction of the cost, as compared to their traditional full-time counterpart. Many companies are finding this part-time CTO as a smart choice. As the name implies, a CTO is a part-time employee and utilizes like other on-demand services, on a part-time, retainer, or as-needed basis.One-time CTO ServicesThis option is a perfect match for the one-time job or is suitable for projectized companies looking for CTO solutions that are not meant to last longer than a project period.Interim CTO servicesAnother collaboration scheme is an interim CTO. It is a technical expert who is normally hired to temporarily collaborate with another full-time internal CTO or any other C-level executives on particular technical or business responsibilities.Cooperation ModelsCTO outsourcing allows you to apply a flexible payment model: depending on the needs of the company, a freelance CTO will work for you when needed: from a few hours a week to a standard full-time job, or from time to time to meet with your agile development team or investors, etc. Let’s also consider the cooperation models between CTO specialists and their company-employers that may be used in practice.CaaS Fixed PriceA fixed cost price model traditionally guarantees a fixed budget for the project, despite the expense and the time required. The main advantage this model is that it allows the clients to plan and set an exact budget for any CTO cooperation with any responsibilities.CaaS Time & MaterialTime & Material approach is the model where the project is drawn up not for a fixed result of the work and its cost, but for the hours of work for the project of specialists and their development during this time. CaaS based on this model works accordingly.CTO ConsultingCTO Consultant oversees the assessment and selection of best technologies. Consulting works closely with the clients in the government, financial services or the services sector to make sure their Digital Transformations success.Benefits of CTO ServicesA full-time technical lead is a must for start-ups and companies at the scaling stage. Senior executives or founders with technical background may better lead the support team on the early stages of developing and manage the technological scope of a project wisely. As the business begins to grow, the company needs a professionally trained ctoaas manager to advise and guide the organization, providing the best technology solutions to achieve business goals and ensure digitalization.When do you need CTO services?Here are some examples of cases when the help of outsourced CTO solutions can be beneficial for your business:1)There’s a great product idea, but you don’t understand how to implement it technically;2)You have developed your first product, feature or a part of the app, but you understand that its architecture does not correspond to the latest stages of your product/service or it is too outdated;3) Your business needs a professional with years of technical leadership experience who can help build a product, effectively discuss technology aspects with investors, evaluate contractors, and create project technical roadmaps;4)You do not need a full-time CTO at the current stage of your company’s development, but you need the maximum level of flexibility and cost-effectiveness, allowing you to pay only for the services that your business needs at the moment;5)You need an unbiased view of various technical issues and an expert to guide your development team on that.If at least one or more of the above cases is yours, then CTO solutions are something that can help your company strive.CTO’s Roles and ResponsibilitiesWhat does a technical director do? The key responsibility of the CTO is to help the company achieve its financial and marketing goals using an innovative technological approach. This means that the CTO will combine knowledge of existing and new technologies to provide the business with the best possible solutions in the future. Keep in mind that there is no single standard for a CTO’s key roles and responsibilities. The two main purposes are to maintain internal business processes or to help develop innovative products.Technical SkillsOf course, every CTO may have different skills. Sometimes a lack of experience in this role also happens. However, the best skills to look for in a CTO will be:Technical KnowledgeIn the technical field, previous experience and in-depth industry knowledge is vital. Sometimes a technical director can learn along the way, in technical matters, it is a little more complicated. A CTO who is constantly up to date with the latest trends is a good bet.EngineeringThe CTO must have some deep technical experience. In some companies, the technical aspect plays a big role. Over time, this can decrease and sometimes a CTO is not required for programming at all.Safety and ComplianceWill your CTO be required to optimize and manage the organization’s data? In other industries, safety and compliance usually have a much higher priority than tech stack itself. Understanding corporate risk and standards can be painful, but extremely valuable knowledge.Other skillsStrategyAn effective CTO can usually rely on experience and foresee the path to success through digital strategy development.Product managementIn high tech, technology and product often go back to back. The CTO must understand the product life cycle and how to create and maintain new products.Negotiation and mentoringIn order for their departments to operate effectively, the CTO needs to know the strengths and weaknesses of their employees and know how to get the most out of them. The ability to inspire people and convince them of their vision has its benefits. A good technical director should be someone worthy attention.How to Find the Right External CTO?If your business needs a reliable technical consultant to create an effective tech strategy, manage a development team and communicate with your investors and customers, or you also need support to advance your business with cutting-edge technology in line with your strategic priorities, then you need to find a CTO of your dream and the outsource companies will help.Outsource CompaniesAny type of cooperation, part-time, full time or any other, are available with the top outsourced digital companies on flexible terms. The team at companies like that has many years of practical experience in programming, system architecture, and software design, as well as in technical consulting. For startups, small and medium-sized companies, it may become not just a development contractor, a technology consultant, and a reliable business partner.How to Evaluate Candidates?The dilemma is that CTO is a position that fits somewhere between technical execution, operational management, and executive representation. The best CTO has some experience with all of this.Depending on the industry, the size of the organization, and the age of the business, companies’ needs typically boil down to two CTO roles: technical and operational management mostly. To faster consider their skillsReflect on their experience.Assess their education.Compare salary expectations.And check on the cultural fit.Remember that to find the right candidate easily you need to apply fast, unbiased, and affordable testing.CTO Services CostCTOs generally work more than 40 hours per week like top officials. They may be paid higher in comparison with the other technical personnel. The USA range typically falls between $243,609 and $303,229. Costs may vary based on if you’re hiring a freelance fractional CTO or an external agency to act as your CTO, etc. Some CTOs work independently, while others are a part of certain organization. Thus, a virtual CTO as an independent contractor might charge you $50-$200+/hour or they might request equity instead.Fireart as your CTO Services PartnerFor the success of both tech start-ups and globally established software companies, the role of the Chief Technology Officer is essential. The CTO leads all technical issues and oversees all related processes to solve problems related to the company’s software products.Technical business savvy, CTO with a sense of business is always an advantage in helping to meet the needs of end users. For many companies, this may include the role of CTO implementing CRM and ERP and supporting international teams with technical issues and so much more.The technical lead is an experienced professional with deep experience in programming, cloud configuration, design and other related disciplines. They write the code themselves and check the code written by other developers. Such a CTO is usually associated with technology start-ups.

Features and outcomes has been… | by Arfan Ismail | Dec, 2022 | MediumArfan IsmailFollowDec 19·2 min readFeatures and OutcomesFeatures and outcomes has been discussed to death and it’s difficult to know what else can be added to this discussion. The only additional thing that can be added is experience I figure, so I’ll give my experience.Language is about communicating meaning. The precision of the words we choose matters at times and sometimes does not matter at all. It’s all about the audience. As an example I’ve found from exprience that when working with engineers one needs to be very precise in the language we use since engineers are themselves engaged in the process of precsion engineering.It is important for product managers to distinguish between outcomes and features. Outcomes refer to the benefits or results that a product or feature is intended to deliver to the user or the business. For example, an outcome of Microsoft Teams could be ‘ability to engage in break-out activities’.On the other hand, features are the specific functions or capabilities that a product or service offers. For example, for Microsoft Teams a feature could be break-out rooms.Distinguishing between outcomes and features is important for several reasons:Prioritization: By focusing on outcomes rather than features, product managers can prioritize the development of features that will have the most impact and deliver the greatest value to the user or the business.Goal alignment: Outcomes provide a clear and measurable way to determine whether a product or feature is meeting its intended goals. This can help product managers align the development of the product with the overall business objectives.Customer focus: By focusing on outcomes, product managers can ensure that they are delivering value to the customer and meeting their needs. This can help increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.Collaboration: Distinguishing between outcomes and features can also facilitate collaboration and communication within the product development team and with other stakeholders, as it provides a clear and concise way to describe the purpose and value of a product or feature.In essence what this distinction between fearures and outcomes is trying to do is get folks to focus on the delivery of value to the customer, that is something that will make their lives in some way better. You might say a feature will deliver value and it may do so but consider this: A feature that allows you stop people skipping ahead in a shared Teams presentation. What we want to focus on both from our software build and also crucially in our communications/marketing to customers is the value it delivers. That coud be something like: control your shared PowerPoint presentations or share your presentations in powerpoint and this feature forms part of that outcome. In that sense we prioritise the features we build against the outcome we want to deliver. I hope this makes sense!FeaturesRoadmapsProduct ManagementProductStartup----1More from Arfan IsmailFollowLove podcasts or audiobooks?

This management process can be difficult, but it is essential to the long-term success of a business.It is important to have a clear vision for what a product should do and how it should be delivered to customers. A good product manager can help make this vision a reality.What is Product Management?Product management is the process of managing the creation, release, and ongoing support of a product. It encompasses everything from defining the product vision to setting product goals and objectives to developing and executing a product plan.It is necessary to keep in mind that this section entails not just physical products but also software, service, and information products; everything that a company develops and offers as a result of its labour.Because product management is such an important part of business, it is essential to have a well-rounded individual in this role. A product team must be able to think critically, communicate effectively, and work with others to create a successful product.Why is Product Management Important?Adapts your offering to meet market demands.One important business goal of product management is to ensure that the strategies and development that you use on a particular device are appropriate to what the market wants.By doing this, businesses can create and deliver something that will be useful to their customers.Products that solve problems or meet needs will generally be highly valued because they solve problems and fulfil needs, which will in turn enable them to be more profitable.Increases customer satisfaction.When a product is well-designed and meets the needs of its customers, they are more likely to be satisfied with it. Satisfied customers are more likely to return and recommend your product, which can lead to increased sales. In addition, satisfied customers are more likely to provide positive feedback about your product, which can help you improve it over time.Improves resource allocation.Product management can help businesses make better decisions about which type of product to develop and release, as well as which resources to allocate to them.By understanding the needs of the market, businesses can more easily identify products that are likely to be successful. This knowledge can also help businesses save money on development costs, as well as on product marketing and other support initiatives.Optimizes and accelerates delivery.Product management can help businesses achieve a rapid release schedule for their products. By ensuring that product features are well-designed and that they meet the needs of their customers, businesses can reduce the amount of time it takes to bring a product to market.This is an important advantage when competing against other businesses, as it allows them to offer products that are more quickly available.Improves sales strategies.A well-executed product strategy can help businesses increase sales. Product owners and managers need to have a clear understanding of what customers want and need in order to develop products that will meet those needs.In addition, they need to be able to create effective sales pitches that highlight the features and benefits of the product. By doing this, businesses can increase their profits margins and reach new customers.What is the Role of a Product Manager?A product manager’s role is responsible for the overall management of a product. The ability to think critically, communicate effectively, and work well with others is essential for success in this role. They also need to be able to set product goals and objectives, as well as develop product planning.The responsibilities of product managers can vary depending on the type of product that they are managing. In some cases, the product managers may be responsible for developing the overall market strategies for the product, while in others they may be responsible for specific aspects of the development process.It is important to note that a product manager is not just responsible for product life cycles that are released by their company; they are also responsible for products that are developed by other companies that are associated with their company in some way.In larger organizations, the role of product manager may be divided into roles such as technical product manager, group product manager, product owner, and growth product manager.ConclusionProduct management is an important role in any business. It is necessary to have a well-rounded individual in this role in order to think critically, communicate effectively, and work well with others. By doing this, businesses can achieve a rapid release schedule for their products, as well as improve their sales strategies.About the AuthorI hope that my post has helped you know more about Entrepreneurship and Startups.

It is a tough balance, but it is required to achieve engineering and product excellence.There is always newer technology around the corner. So, I have always pondered over a question while facing such situations:How should teams approach this paradox of looking to the future while still focusing on launching robust products today?While working on quite a few such scenarios, I have found that a successful strategy is to analyse and evaluate rapidly evolving trends based on following 3 parameters:1. Focus on valueCustomers don’t care about latest technology trends or what tech you are using to build your product. Technology trends alone don’t add any value. Customers don’t buy technologies and/or tools. Customers are looking for a solution to their problem regardless of how that solution is implemented. See what core value the new tech trend provides in the problem you are trying to solve and if it can help us provide a better solution for the customers.2. Is your company ready to adopt this trend?See if your company is equipped to carry the product with the new tech through its complete lifecycle. We should stretch the capabilities of our org, but only to the extent that it makes sense.3. Is the trend ready to be productised?Determine if the new tech is ready to be deployed at scale. For example, blockchain might have a lot of promise in the future, but it might not be ready for you to include in your next release today.One of the key things in building and launching successful products is striking the right, delicate balance between understanding customer’s pains/ needs, the capabilities of our company and the new tech/ tools.Thoughts? What strategy do you adopt to strike such a balance? What strategies have worked for you?Cheers!RajendraSoftware DevelopmentSoftware EngineeringProduct Management----More from Rajendra UppalFollowSenior Software Engineering Manager at Microsoft, Avid Reader, Ex Adobe, IIT Delhi, www.linkedin.com/in/rajendrauppalLove podcasts or audiobooks?

What should you do if the number of users is not growing like it once was?Don’t panic — user growth can fluctuate from many factors. Let’s look at the levers you can pull to put it back on track up and to the right.Start with user acquisitionWhen user growth slows the problem lies in user acquisition, in everything that happens before the user gets into your product and tries it. It means that your audience can’t reach the product.To solve the problem, you can revise your processes. How are you attracting your users? Is it:Paid trafficSearch engine optimizationSocial media postingCold outreachOr something different like digital PR?Make a list of your current acquisition marketing and sales activities, and add the possible ones. Don’t ignore the channels, changes that happened over time, and the results you’ve got while using various tools. See what your competitors do and find benchmarks.Sometimes the core of the problem is just us being lazy and using fewer channels to acquire users, or simply using the wrong channels. For example, for Web3 products, it’s easier to find your audience with the help of communities rather than via paid traffic. Each service and product requires a different approach. Think about which one suits your product and customer profile.Find the right buyer personaThe first thought that must pop into your mind if the audience is not growing is what you MUST do to attract users. Are you doing the right things now? To answer this question you need to understand clearly:Who’s your buyer/customer/userAre you reaching your audience via the right channelIs your offer the right one or notThe easiest way to find out is to ask your clients about their needs and whether your offer solves their problems or not.Learn from your past experiencesGrowingFlags exampleWhen I was working on acquiring users to GrowthFlags, a simple tool that brings feature flags, a/b testing & experimentation culture to any product, we bet big on cold outreach via Linkedin, because it worked perfectly on previous projects.We used founders, CEO, CTO, and CPO of product IT companies as buying personas and the problem of low delivery speed as our key offer. We talked about our product with early-stage startups and companies already on the market for a while — saying GrowthFlags can double the delivery speed.We contacted around 500 people on Linkedin but got only 2 leads and a Conversion Rate (CR) of 0,4%. So what the hell went wrong?As I looked back on the work done, I can see several issues:We didn’t contact the right person within the companies. If the company is big enough, C-levels are hard to reach or they won’t be changing their processes without a clear problem. Early-stage companies usually understood our offer but said they were not big enough to use it.Low delivery speed is not a crucial pain point for the companies and they can survive without using feature flags.So we stopped our cold outreach to work more on our offer and the people we want to reach. Don’t let such mistakes stop you. Just find another approach to find your audience.Equiline Systems exampleSome time ago I was working on a product that helped manage company processes and resources. It was a complex of boards and analytics to see the whole scope of the projects and the people working on them. We also decided to do a cold outreach via Linkedin and focused on C-level executives as our buying personas (just CEO and HRs this time) and focused on outsourcing companies.Our offer was based on solving the problem of unclear costs of companies’ resources. We provided a solution to manage the resources effectively with the help of analytical reports.We contacted only 50 people, but already got 2 leads and 4% CR. The results were way better than in the previous example, right? And that’s simply because we defined the buying persona and the problem better.What else to do to attract usersTo grow the audience of your product you can also:Double-check your analytics: Sometimes the problem is not in the product or your offer, but in the analytical system itself showing the wrong numbers. So check it once more.Always track your user-acquisition activities: All the actions, results, experiments, and changes. You need to understand what action leads to the problem. It will allow you to go back and fix the problem faster.Do experiments! Without experiments, you won’t be able to tell which audience or the offer are the right ones. For GrowthFlags we used classic HEDI cycles when we selected our audiences one after another without mixing them up. While experimenting also remembers that your messages must match your actual offer.Follow the trends: Be on the edge of technology, current pains and needs to find the right audience.Be positive and stay strong. Even if you made a mistake with your user acquisition strategy, buyer personas or analytics, learn from it and move on to another experiment.Originally published at growing-products.paralect.com.

Most of the product data and qualities are covered by a comprehensive solution, which manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and retailers are searching for.Product Management can help in this situation.Product management offers business owners an enterprise platform to maintain consistency in their product information across various marketing and sales channels.It makes it possible for the owners of the data — both internal and external to the organization — to continuously monitor the quality of the product data when used in conjunction with an e-commerce platform.All value chain actors have easy access to product information in all formats, wherever and whenever they need it.Retailing on the internet (E-Tailing)Retail has a life cycle, with newer forms of retail displacing older ones. For example, a corner grocer may become a supermarket.Retailing is the act of selling goods or services directly to customers, whether it’s in a store, online, over the phone, through the mail, or at a vending machine.It usually has the following characteristics:Limitless selectionNo product touch or feelMore information increases the buying power of customerConsumers must plan their purchases in advanceOnline payments eliminate the requirement for handling cash24 hours a day, seven days per week serviceIssues with E-Tailing:Logistics support for salesPayment gatewaysCustomer product returnsConflicts with brick-and-mortar stores that can be resolved by offering different productsProduct Management in Omni-Channel RetailingProduct management in omni-channel retail refers to the process of overseeing the development, marketing, and sales of products in a retail environment that utilizes multiple channels, such as physical stores, e-commerce websites, and mobile apps.This includes managing the entire product life cycle, from ideation and development to launch and post-launch analysis.In an omni-channel retail environment, the product management process is complex and requires a holistic approach that considers the needs and preferences of consumers across all channels.This requires product managers to have a deep understanding of customer behaviour, market trends, and the competitive landscape.Key Aspects of PM in Omni-Channel RetailOne key aspect of product management in omni-channel retail is the development of a product roadmap.This is a high-level plan that outlines the key features and milestones for a product, including the timing and resources needed to bring it to market. Product roadmap is a crucial tool for aligning the efforts of different teams and stakeholders, and for tracking the progress of a product as it moves through the development process.Another important aspect of product management in omni-channel retail is the management of product inventory.This involves forecasting demand for a product, determining the optimal level of inventory to maintain, and ensuring that inventory levels are sufficient to meet customer demand across all channels. This can be a complex task, as it is prone to factors such as seasonality, promotions, and changes in consumer behaviour.Effective Product ManagementEffective product management in omni-channel retail involves developing and implementing strategies for the marketing mix.Best practices include determining the optimal price point for a product, as well as identifying the best channels and tactics for promoting and distributing it. In an omni-channel retail environment, this may involve leveraging data from various channels to inform pricing and promotion decisions.In addition to managing the development and marketing of products, product managers in omni-channel retail must also be responsible for analysing and tracking the performance of products in the market.This includes monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, profitability, and customer satisfaction, and using this data to make informed decisions about how to optimize the product and its marketing efforts.Effective product management in omni-channel retail also requires a strong understanding of the latest technologies and trends in the retail industry.This includes an understanding of data analytics, e-commerce platforms, and other tools and technologies that can be used to optimize the product management process.One of the biggest challenges faced by product managers in omni-channel retail is the need to coordinate and align the efforts of different teams and stakeholders across multiple channels.This requires strong communication and collaboration skills, as well as the ability to build consensus and drive results in a complex, fast-paced environment.Bringing all to a conclusionIn conclusion, product management in omni-channel retail is a complex and challenging role that requires a holistic approach and a deep understanding of customer behaviour, market trends, and the competitive landscape.It involves managing the entire product life cycle, from ideation and development to launch and post-launch analysis and requires strong communication and collaboration skills to coordinate the efforts of different teams and stakeholders across multiple channels.Liked the article?

At Masters’ Union Product Management… | by Santanu Bhattacharjee | Dec, 2022 | MediumSantanu BhattacharjeeFollowDec 18·4 min readCredits: Indian Meme TemplatesMy first Startup WeekendAt Masters’ Union Product Management BootcampINTRODUCTIONShark Tank India has taken the country by storm. It has definitely taught us an awful lot about business and entrepreneurship. But I “had” always wondered about the experience of going to Angel Investors and VCs and asking for money. “Had”, because recently I got the opportunity to do just that.Masters’ Union School of Business offers a Product Management Bootcamp course which features an event called Startup Weekend. Participants are given a weekend to create a business opportunity and pitch it before a jury. The pitch may or may not be a fundraiser. The intention is to induce an entrepreneurial mindset within the students.HOW IT ALL WENT DOWNEven before joining Masters’ Union, I was very excited about the Startup Weekend, and the first one delivered more than I had asked for. We were told this time it would be a week-long event. We were divided into teams. My team had 5 other members, all of who were from my cohort (all other teams had members from the previous cohort who had done this before). And we were given a theme of Hospitality and Tourism. Not really sure what to do, our team decided to get into a group call and discuss. We started with what we thought could be a decent idea to work on, but after talking to customers, we realized how wrong we were. However, we drew new insights from our customer conversations, discussed them among ourselves and came up with a new idea. Not everyone was on board with the new idea, but due to time constraints, the team decided to move forward with it. Our next checkpoint was a session with a mentor, where he pointed out several flaws in our idea. We took the feedback, went back to the drawing board, and pivoted. But this time we were all very excited about the idea. We polished some rough edges (some ifs and buts) and went back for a second mentoring session. We returned with a few more feedback regarding everything, the idea, the implementation and the CSR initiative. We got back together, analyzed the feedback and analyzed what modifications were needed. But also realized that we are less than 24 hours from submission. Yes, that’s right, we spent almost the entire week talking among ourselves, talking to people and getting feedback from mentors. The team showed real grit and determination as we raced against time to create a business model, wireframe, marketing strategy and a CSR initiative within the few remaining hours.After a mostly sleepless night, the moment had come when every team would present their pitch deck. The presentation time was 3 mins + 2 additional mins for Q&A. The competition was tough, and there were some really innovative presentations. Everyone came well-prepared. But so were we, as when the time had come, we unleashed our secret weapon, a Toastmaster. Yes, that’s right, our presenter was a Toastmaster and delivered perhaps the best pitch of the day. Our Q&A session went alright. We had also looked to raise money which introduced additional scrutiny. But we were eventually satisfied with how things went for us.TAKEAWAYAlthough a Startup “Weekend”, it was a week-long event and an opportunity for week-long accelerated learning. The takeaways were massive as we learnt first-hand a thing or two about starting a business and pitching it to potential investors. But the icing on the cake was really the result, as we were declared 2nd Runners Up (Yay!).Credits: Meme Template HouseHere are 5 things that I have learnt:1) Be a critic of your work. Raise the bar, and think harder about the problem.2) Be research-driven, and look at what others have done and are doing (obvious, but sometimes we get driven by our ideas and miss this part).3) Good communication, and the impact it can have (gave us an edge over our competitors).4) How to create a business model.5) Deliver a seamless experience to the user. Any part that you cannot control can/will break the experience.CONCLUSIONIt was my first Startup Weekend and what I have learnt gets me excited thinking about the ones yet to come. I am sure they will be even more exciting, with more opportunities to learn, from both the event and my co-founders (teammates). And I will definitely write about my experiences, so follow me to read about them and share this blog with others.Credits: India TodayProduct ManagementPitch DeckStartup----More from Santanu BhattacharjeeFollowAn experienced NLP Engineer working for Samsung R&D Bangalore India, and looking to transition into a Product Management role.Love podcasts or audiobooks?

Part 9, article #65Communication is the process of exchanging information between two or more people, groups and organizations.Communication is a complex, multi-level process that includes speech, intelligence and human psychology, aimed at developing and establishing relationships between people in society.The main attribute of communication is universality, the ability to connect all forms of human relationships, giving each person a chance to realize himself as a unique person, finding mutual understanding with other people.Communication is a form of interpersonal relationships that includes communicative, interactive and perceptual functions.The communicative function is the ability of people to exchange information between each other; the perceptual function regulates the perception of each other;the interactive function organizes interaction between people according to the type of business, personal, official communication.One of the most important types of human communication is communication.1. Types of communication:Verbal — nonverbal consists of oral and written contacts with the transmission of various kinds of data. Nonverbal communication, in turn, implies the transmission of data without the use of the language of words, speech of an oral or written nature. In this case, the individual receives information with the help of his vision, noticing such characteristic elements of behavior as, for example, facial expression, human postures, facial expressions and gestures, appearance in general. Nonverbal communication significantly complements, demonstrates or emphasizes what a person says. In some cases, nonverbal signals and oral speech somewhat contradict each other. In this case, a person, as a rule, tends to trust his own eyes more than his ears. It turns out that nonverbal communication sometimes even surpasses verbalInterpersonal — interethnic ‒ intercultural in its own effectiveness,The concept of “interpersonal communication” means the process of exchanging messages and their interpretation by two or more individuals who have come into contact with each other.MythologicalMythological communication is a special type of communication in which myths act as an instrument of influence of the communicator on the audience. Myths combine the rational and the irrational, which allows you to directly address the unconscious and human emotions.ArtisticThis is the realization of the intellectual and creative relationship between the author and the recipient, the transfer to the latter of artistic information containing a certain attitude to the world, an artistic concept, stable value orientations”MassThis is one of the types of social communication, which implies the dissemination of information to a mass audience in a wide space-time range.2. Terms of communication:direct or direct communication with active feedback (dialogue) or with delayed feedback (written order, radio message, etc.)indirect communication (speech on television, in the media, etc.)Number of participants:monologuedialoguepolylogue3. Communication objectives:InformingPersuasion (including motivation, explanation, etc., up to destabilization through threat or aggression)Entertainment…4. The nature of communication:business communication (report, lecture, discussion)public communication (meeting, meetinghousehold communication (chatter, small talk, chat)5. Effectiveness of communication:expediency of verbal and/or non-verbal means used,correlation of verbal and/or non-verbal communication techniques with the goals and objectives of communication, communicative intention and perspective.be able to effectively form a communication strategy,be able to effectively use a variety of communication techniques,be able to effectively represent yourself as a participant in the communication process.6. The reasons for the “communicative failure”:inaccuracy of the statement;inappropriate use of professional terms;excessive use of foreign words;misinterpretation of the interlocutor’s intentions;incomplete informing of the partner;fast pace of presentation;incomplete concentration of attention,floridness of thought;inadequate intonation, facial expressions and gestures that do not match the words;the presence of semantic gaps and jumps of thought , etc.Communication ethicsproduct managementEthics is the doctrine of morality, a set of rules and norms of moral behavior in society. Speech etiquette embodies the principles of communicative ethics.Any communication has a goal or goals, they can be very diverse, thanks to them, four main types of communication can be distinguished:— Etiquette (shallow, superficial, formal), defined by customs, relationships between people: passengers, customers, casual acquaintances.— Business, professional (the sphere of social, labor activity, production), where certain social groups of people are formed, united by a single goal, performing their functional duties: employees, students, students, other collectives;— Tverskoy, the formation takes place on the basis of the business sphere of relations, when the members of the team are connected by the principles of recognition of each other, a sense of team, unity, manifestations of complicity, support, united by a common cause and ideas;— Friendly, implies a deep level of spiritual unity, a special, strong type of relationship based on common interests, sympathy, psychological compatibility, common guidelines, values, readiness for self-sacrifice, selfless support, etc.;The culture of communication largely depends on a person’s practical mastery of ethical rules of behavior. The process of communication is improvement, self-education and self-education. The use of verbal and non-verbal techniques in the process of communication allows people to exchange information and directly influence each other.The word verbal, from the Latin word Verbum — communication, is carried out through written and oral speech, as well as through electronic technical means. Speech is an instrument of communication, transmission and exchange of thoughts, feelings, ideas. The relationship of speech and thinking is closely intertwined with human culture. The ability to use the culture of speech, depending on the situation, to use spoken or literary speech, the ability to turn to the use of written or oral communication is a gift or painstaking work on yourself.For a relaxed, understandable and accessible explanation, you need a sufficient vocabulary, the ability to think logically, to follow the sequence of thoughts expressed. In the culture of communication, purity of speech is important, it is necessary to avoid mistakes in spoken words, avoid parasitic words, you should monitor diction, tonality, timbre, you also need to remember the versatility of speech communication. An important detail is the correspondence of speech, cultural and professional level of the listener.Communication is usually accompanied by “body language” — a look, facial expressions, gestures, posture, various expressive movements, which are elements of non-verbal communication. A person makes a variety of movements on a conscious, but more often on a subconscious level, this is his natural physiology. Therefore, even applying considerable effort, training hard, he will not be able to fully control his body, that is, nonverbal behavior.Depending on the complexity of the situation, a person’s forehead sweats, the complexion changes (turns red, turns pale), hands tremble or tremble, the pupils of the eyes widen, the eyes run noticeably, etc. Posture, gestures, gait, manner of dressing can tell a lot about a person’s character. Fruitful communication is an art based on the skillful, correct use of the nonverbal system of means, the development of qualities such as observation, attentiveness in order to adequately perceive, evaluate a partner and behave according to the current situation.Communicative ethics as a type of interpersonal relationsCommunicative ethics as a type of interpersonal relations is based on such concepts:— the golden rule is the basis of morality;— moral principles, attitude towards other people;— attributes of moral life: guilt, repentance, forgiveness;— tolerance is the foundation of interpersonal relationships, any interpersonal relationships are based on the principles of morality. The most important principle in human relations is the “golden rule”, “justice”, “humanism”, “tolerance”.The golden rule is a universal principle of moral attitude to another person, regardless of the situation, for every person who is not devoid of morality, it is mandatory. Only when you can get into the position of another person, you will be able to treat him as yourself.Moral behavior towards another person is the basis for recognizing the value of personality, human dignity. The principle of humanism is based on moral relations.The Golden Rule, together with the principle of humanism, contributes to the formation of values in interpersonal relationships, thereby influencing all spheres of human activity. These values are defined by such concepts as tolerance, delicacy, correctness, tact, politeness, condescension.The concept of forgiveness, guilt, remorse is a derivative of moral life. A person is not always able to comply with moral principles, this happens when he finds himself in difficult life situations, or in situations of moral choice. A sense of guilt is caused by not fulfilling a moral duty and not conforming behavior to moral principles. Not doing what is due, the possibility of committing an immoral, unseemly offense is a source of guilt. Getting rid of guilt is forgiveness.Forgiveness includes concepts such as:— resentment, getting rid of it— respect of another person— the possibility of everyone making a mistake.Tolerance is the ability to maintain communication with people who are different from others (skin color, physical differences, individual characteristics, thinking styles, culture) and do not adhere to generally accepted opinions.Tolerance is the perception of other people as they are, respect for their customs, point of view, faith.To accept people as they are means to be aware of the right of other people to be different, not to reveal hostility, not to feel irritation means to be tolerant.Having made a detailed analysis of all types of communicative, human relationships, we can make an unambiguous conclusion that any relationship is based on ethical norms, and the golden rule is the standard of human relations.Thank you for your attention ❤️My social networks:https://www.linkedin.com/in/konstantindrProduct ManagementUXMarketingDevelopmentCommunication----More from KonstantinDrFollowThe most valuable things about #Product management #UX and #Web3 https://www.linkedin.com/in/konstantindrLove podcasts or audiobooks?

In the book I cover the common tensions inherent in managing products and offer practical ways in which product managers can deal with this. I’ve received a lot of positive reactions to the book from people who have recognised the challenges I outlined and appreciated the techniques proposed. The book has inspired a number of workshops and interactions which have led to valuable conversations with product managers about the challenges and pressures they face.Since I published the book, I’ve observed a number of challenges that weren’t covered at the time, so I thought it might be useful to reflect on a couple of them here:Project vs ProductThere is still a lot of work to be done to move from a project to a product mindset — from outputs to outcomes. Whenever I compare notes with product peers or recruiters, it’s apparent that a lot of companies could benefit from transitioning to a more product-centric way of working. There isn’t one way to do product management or deliver value to customers, however all too often I see talented product people working on projects and related tasks (i.e. focused on output, moving from one project to the next) instead of doing product discovery and delivering customer value early and often. This doesn’t make them bad product managers. It just means that a lot of potential value isn’t being unlocked, value that could be significant to businesses and customers.I believe it starts by asking these simple questions:Why is it important to solve this problem for our customers?What are we trying to achieve here?How do we ensure that our solution delivers these outcomes?How will we differentiate from our competitors?What are the product risks that we need to cater for?This isn’t about ‘good vs bad product managers, but it’s disappointing to see product people not adding the value I know they can. The good news is that lots of organisations do have the desire to become more product and customer centric and are spending time and effort supporting their product people. For more on this topic, I highly recommend connecting with experienced product people like Pippa Topp, Iain McNeill, Petra Wille and Saeed Khan who do a lot of great work with teams to transition from project to product.Tech layoffs and other disruptionsRecently there have been a number of layoff rounds at technology organisations, some more high profile than others. Whilst often necessary from a business point of view, redundancies and reorganisations are disruptive — for the people affected as well as for the organisation as a whole. It can cause the colleagues who remain to feel unsettled, sometimes needing time to adjust themselves or come to terms with the change in organisational direction. But as tough as it can be, it can also provide an opportunity for businesses and employees to take stock. We can take a step back and reflect on our ‘True North’. What is truly important? What is the business truly good at? I’ve been affected by layoffs and have seen firsthand the sobering effect on the organisation and its people. Redundancies are never easy, and I say that as someone who has sat on both sides of the table, but they do lead to a valuable period of introspection and reset which ultimately strengthens people and businesses alike.I’m always impressed with the level of resilience and adjustment that people and organisations possess. Managing Product = Managing Tension covers what Scott Belsky calls ‘The Messy Middle’, describing the real journey for most companies and their people; it’s a collection of ups and downs all the way from start to finish. The companies that end up winning are those that adjust early and often, especially in the face of major business model disruptions such as generative AI or macro-economic circumstances. This level of agility comes from people and their mindset, supported by a set of repeatable product processes (think product discovery, decision-making and opportunity opportunity assessments).ConclusionTensions are inherent in everything we do. As product managers we need to understand actual and potential tensions and the situations or systems in which these arise. There are a number of valuable tools out there that we can use to better manage this.For my part, I continue to work with product people and teams to help them with discovery and goal-setting — please don’t hesitate to get in touch if you’re keen on 1:1 coaching or team workshops. Tensions are inherent in product management, they won’t go away but can be managed.Product Management----More from MAA1FollowProduct at Intercom, author of ""My Product Management Toolkit"" and “Managing Product = Managing Tension” — see https://bit.ly/3gH2dOD.Love podcasts or audiobooks?

Especially observing the “dream” valuation coming back to reality & with prudent earning multiples becoming more of a norm— gets me to revisit some of my observations, thinkings, & beliefs, coupled with recent readings and discussions with friends. Sharing it below —Not hard to google the definition of what an MVP is; I am sure many version exists & it will be largely around solving well for a challenge your target user group faces. However, defining it & building it involves a lot of subjectivity, alignment & personal/team’s judgement. How I am currently thinking about it — surly it will evolve over timeThe problems must be big enough to solve (the space shall be evolving, driven by mission & vision). Sizing is largely defined by estimate, guided by statistics, financial modelling and primary/secondary research. MVP might not (& usually cannot) need to have a positive margin — here I refer to the law of 40Promoting & driving the adoption of the product should not be an afterthought; it is super important, especially in a competitive market. In an “red ocean” world and supposedly we are competing with McDonald — one can essentially win by launching a McDonald equivalent but deliver it to your doorstep. That’s the whole point of “embedded finance” anywayThe product must have a “moat”. Product managers should think hard on what is the competitive advantage the company & Team — e.g., a license, network of users/effects, technology/people expertise, economise of scale / price, brands name (& in financial services, TRUST)**** If you are a challenger, you can try to build a temporary moat by playing the game theory. Large players usually do not want to cannibalize its own business by competing with a challenger directly, risking & fearing that — other major incumbent join the war — make the whole industry worse****The reason why we strive to dominate in the market of our target customer group — is to not having to compete on price****Ideas can be copied easily, it will eventually drive a seemingly high-barrier-to-entry business into a commodity; and subject to only price factor & switching cost; obviously it benefits consumers a lotBe Agile & Iterate fast. Continuouly (probably more is needed) demonstrate the progress and impact you are making, even after launch. I see a strong correlation, in large corp — the more they focus on MVP/Launch, the less they care about the learnings & continuous improvement of the product. People’s opinion is the hardest to change, after all.That’s all. I am sure I will learn more along the way, reflect more and hopefully to share more in the future as well.Product ManagementProduct ManagerProduct Market FitProduct DevelopmentProduct----More from BootcampFollowFrom idea to product, one lesson at a time.

A new insight in writing Amazon PR-FAQ… | by Divjot Singh | Dec, 2022 | MediumDivjot SinghFollowDec 18·3 min readEigenquestionsA new insight in writing Amazon PR-FAQ based PRDBackgroundI heard about Eigenquestions on a couple of podcasts last month, so I searched about it to read it from horse’s mouth itself:(Eigenquestions: The Art of Framing Problems · Eigenquestions (coda.io)). The term is coined by Shishir Mehrotra, Co-Founder & CEO of coda.io. Although the term does seem daunting, and probably nerdy (and definitely sexy!!), the concept is extremely simple.First things first — the context of eigenquestions comes while framing a problem statement. So let’s have a quick understanding of Framing.What is Framing?Framing is the process of breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable parts in order to better understand and solve it. It involves identifying key issues, making choices and trade-offs, and considering different options. In the context of product management, framing is important because it helps product managers and their teams to unblock and move forward with their work. Eigenquestions, coined by Shishir Mehrotra, are a specific type of framing technique that involve asking questions that reveal the underlying assumptions or structure of a problem.By using eigenquestions, product managers can better understand the root causes of a problem and identify potential solutions.What are Eigenquestions?“For a simplistic definition, the eigenquestion is the question where, if answered, it likely answers the subsequent questions as well.” Shishir Mehrotra, Co-Founder, Coda.ioLet’s take an example. Let’s say in a product manager interview, you are asked this question:You are designing a game to teach kids math in a fun way, where do you start?You can obviously list down all the potential questions, but let’s say you can only ask 2 questions. What would be these two questions that can tell you the most about your starting point to design a new math game for kids?For example, I can ask:Will it be an electronic / app based game OR physical/board game?Will it be suitable fo 1–3 years age group OR 4–6 years age group?These could be bad examples for eigenquestions. But even based on these two questions, I can create a micro-strategy of where I would go next.Amazon PR — FAQ format and EigenquestionsFor some time now, I have been using Amazon PR — FAQ format to create a PRD. I dont follow the Amazon PR framework completely, but the FAQ format forces me to think thoroughly andWhile writing FAQs, I have witnessed many times that there are some questions when they are answered first, they also answer subsequent questions by themselves. It is like the squares on Minesweeper that gives maximum information about adjacent squares. The best way to play minesweeper is not to flag all mines, but to use minimum clicks to reveal all required information. Eigenquestions are the questions, which when answered, also answer a lot of subsequent questions.I will go as far to name eigenquestions as Paretoquestions. 20% of the questions when answered will answer 80% of all the subsequent questions.And hence eigenquestions are not only important but also should be put on top so that readers quickly grasp the underlying assumptions / approach.Reading the eigenquestions article made immediate sense because now I know what can I call these questions and why they are so important.Resources:Eigenquestions: The Art of Framing Problems · Eigenquestions (coda.io)Amazing Podcast between Shishir and Lenny: The rituals of great teams | Shishir Mehrotra, Coda, YouTube, Microsoft — YouTubeProduct ManagementProblem SolvingLenny Kravitz----More from Divjot SinghFollowEd-tech.

Here are a few ways product managers can be great growth hackers:Identify growth opportunities: Product managers should be constantly on the lookout for new opportunities to grow the business, whether through new products or features, new markets, or new customer segments.Prioritize growth initiatives: Once potential growth opportunities have been identified, product managers should prioritize them based on their potential impact, feasibility, and alignment with the overall business strategy.Collaborate with cross-functional teams: Growth hacking requires a cross-functional approach, and product managers should work closely with marketing, sales, customer success, and other teams to identify and execute on growth initiatives.Use data to drive decision-making: Product managers should use data to inform their decisions about which growth initiatives to pursue and how to optimize them for maximum impact. Product managers can use data to drive decision-making in a number of ways. Here are a few suggestions:Identify key metrics: Product managers should identify the key metrics that are most important for their product and track them regularly. These metrics might include things like user engagement, conversion rates, retention, and revenue.Analyze user behavior: Product managers can use data to understand how users are interacting with their product and identify areas for improvement. This might involve analyzing user behavior through tools like heat maps, session recordings, and user feedback.A/B testing: A/B testing is a method for comparing two different versions of a product to see which one performs better. Product managers can use A/B testing to test different hypotheses and make data-driven decisions about which changes to make to the product.Customer segmentation: Product managers can use data to segment their customers into different groups based on their characteristics, behaviors, or needs. This can help product managers create targeted product features or marketing campaigns that are more likely to resonate with specific customer segments.Collaborate with other teams: Product managers should work closely with teams such as data science, marketing, and engineering to gather and analyze data that can inform product decisions. By collaborating with these teams, product managers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the product and its users.5. Experiment and iterate: Growth hacking is all about experimentation and iteration, and product managers should be willing to try new things and quickly pivot when needed. Experimentation and iteration are crucial for product managers in growth hacking because they allow product managers to test and validate their assumptions about what will drive growth for their product. By setting up controlled experiments, product managers can systematically test different strategies and tactics to see what works best for driving growth. This allows them to make informed decisions about how to allocate resources and optimize their product to achieve their growth goals. Iteration is also important because it allows product managers to continually improve and optimize their product based on the results of their experiments. By gathering data on what works and what doesn’t, product managers can iterate on their growth strategies and tactics to continually drive growth. Overall, experimentation and iteration are key tools for product managers in growth hacking because they allow them to test and validate their assumptions, make informed decisions, and continuously improve and optimize their product to drive growth.Collaboration is key to growth hacking because it allows product managers to bring together the expertise and resources of multiple teams to focus on a common goal. By working closely with other teams and leveraging their unique skills and perspectives, product managers can more effectively identify and pursue growth opportunities.Photo by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-businesswoman-working-inside-an-office-8528744/Product ManagementProduct ManagerGrowth HackingProductProduct Manager Interview----More from BootcampFollowFrom idea to product, one lesson at a time.

However, getting buy-in and commitment from the people you need to make your product successful can take careful thought and effort.A product vision is a simplified message that communicates the power and impact of your product in a way that someone who knows nothing about it can instantly understand why they should care.To connect with your users, you must first evoke an emotional response. When you do that, you can design, build, and sell your product to the people who need it most. You can create a meaningful product vision by working with stakeholders to help set your team up for success.The value of an inspirational product visionThe Value of an Inspirational Product VisionA good product vision sets a clear direction for teams to follow and aspire to meet. They can feel aspirational or even out of reach, but in the end, the vision articulates clearly what a team will focus on, in what time frame they hope to drive impact or change, and in what time frame they hope to drive impact and change.When applied correctly in a business, a product vision acts as a “north star” to guide the organization and its people.A compelling vision provides a sense of purpose in how the product creates value.A thoughtful vision clarifies how individuals contribute their skills to the project’s success.An aspirational vision guides decision-making.Activity # 1: Simon Sinek’s Golden CircleActivity # 1: Simon Sinek’s Golden CircleThe Golden Circle is a model by Simon Sinek used to create a strong product vision. The model starts with the middle of the circle, the WHY, and works its way out.Starting with WHY is the path to building something remarkable. At its heart, success is about solving problems and understanding why those problems exist in the first place. Then, you make something that lasts by creating your foundation on why this product matters to your customers’ lives.WHYConsider that businesses exist for different reasons-your “WHY” sets your business apart and gives customers and employees a reason to support it.HOWNow use the middle ring to capture “HOW” you will develop a strategy to achieve the “WHY.” Next, identify processes or systems that support your business and set you apart from competitors.WHATLastly, the products or services your company provides are vital to the “WHAT” of your Golden Circle. Finally, the outer-most ring highlights the products and services that make you competitive.When your vision “WHY” transcends profitability, customers and employees will have a deeper connection with it. Therefore, you should display your Golden Circle vision somewhere everyone can see it to drive engagement and success.When to use the Golden Circle Framework?If you are starting with a blank canvas, have not had an entire project team discussion, or feel the team is confused or disconnected on the project deliverables and vision, try starting with WHY using Simon Sinek’s Golden Circle framework.Free Templates for in-person, remote, and hybrid meetings.Download Free PDF TemplateFree Digital Jamboard TemplateActivity #2: Microsoft’s Two-step Product FrameworkActivity #2: Microsoft’s Two-step Product FrameworkMicrosoft provides a simple framework for creating a vision that defines the target user or customer, the problem they’re trying to solve, and the desired outcome. In addition, this framework helps people to consider the product’s impact on the business.Step 1. Describe your users and the impact you hope to make.For… [TARGET USER]Who needs… [USER NEED]The… [PRODUCT/SERVICE NAME]Will provide… [KEY BENEFIT]Step 2. Describe how your product compares to the competition.Unlike… [COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVE]Our product will… [YOUR PRODUCT’S NORTH STAR]“For the business user who needs to be productive in the office and on the go, the Surface is a convertible tablet that is easy to carry and gives you total computing productivity no matter where you are. Unlike laptops, the Surface serves on-the-go needs without having to take an extra device.” — Microsoft Surface’s product vision statement.When to use the Microsoft 2-step Framework?If you have gathered a lot of user insights and feel you have enough input from users and stakeholders, gather a few key members from the project team and try out the Microsoft 2-step Framework.Free Templates for in-person, remote, and hybrid meetings.Download Free PDF TemplateFree Digital Jamboard TemplatePrepare a Brilliant Product Vision SessionPrepare a Brilliant Product Vision SessionWe are passionate about throwing compelling workshops that inspire attendees to participate. The goal is to deliver creative, collaborative, and iterative sessions that unite diverse viewpoints and multi-disciplinary teams.Rember, facilitating discussions is more art than science, so finding your rhythm can take time and practice. Nevertheless, our top recommendations are to ensure you get the most out of your product vision session.Ask the Right QuestionsA vision statement aims to help you define your long-term goals and serve as a guidepost for your team and business decision-making. You want to make sure you’re thinking about the correct problems and defining your goals in a way that will drive your business forward. As Sinek points out, asking simple questions is usually the easier way to solve a complex problem.Do your HomeworkUnderstand your customers, learn about your competitors, and gather relevant information about your local market. Research can is the foundation for developing your vision statement. You should understand who your customer is, their problems, and their unmet needs. You should also know how to solve their problems and offer better value to them.Market research is how Product leaders collect information about user needs. Competitive analysis is a subset of market research. When you study your competition, you use market research techniques to apprehend what your competition is doing today and gain insight into their plans.Invite the Right PeopleInvolving your team to encourage inclusion throughout the process can help ensure your vision is achievable. In fact, including your team will result in buy-in and help promote a sense of ownership: check out our meeting planning and productivity guide for tips on inviting the right people to your session.Make sure you get to know your participants’ backgrounds before the meeting. Set up an informal chat, look through LinkedIn, or send personal messages ahead of time.Deconstruct HierarchyA vision should inspire a team to “make it happen” by overcoming challenges and charging toward success. Don’t worry about titles or who the boss is. To help the team be more imaginative and feel safe to share ideas, coach the senior participants to step off their soapboxes and listen more than they speak. Meetings often have different types of attendees.Some feel like it is a break from the day-to-day.Others may feel they are too busy to attend.A few may feel like they have all the answers.Everyone should adopt an explorer mindset and be open to the ideas, themes, and activities you will work on together.Choose the Right FormatChoose the Right FormatEach format will only work for some. Adapt your technique to fit the format.In-person TeamsPrint pdf activity templates and bring everyone a pen. If you cannot print or want to save paper, use a whiteboard or large chart paper to sketch the activity templates onto a large surface where everyone can add to the worksheet.Hybrid TeamsThe trick with hybrid is to level the playing field and ensure everyone is equipped with the same tools to contribute openly. A session is successful when everyone feels heard and can participate the same way as those in the room or on the phone. Conversely, a disengaging session occurs when one side of the conversation (usually the in-person group) dominates and has an advantage when sharing or receiving information (imagine an impromptu whiteboard moment that phone attendees cannot see).Use the digital whiteboard links to access the collaborative templates. Using pens and markers, use Google images and other features to copy and paste photos to make activities more interactive and visual. Ask participants who plan to attend in person to bring their laptops so they can join the virtual whiteboard too. If that isn’t possible, assign a scribe with a laptop to take notes for the in-person group.Remote TeamsUse the digital whiteboard links to access the collaborative templates. Using pens and markers, use Google images and other features to copy and paste photos to make activities more interactive and visual.Reflect on Your Product VisionReflect on Your Product VisionRevisit your product vision throughout your project. Treat it like a team member and check in on it occasionally. Keep it alive and fresh in the minds of the people bringing it to life. Change it when you learn something new or the direction of the business changes.Consider a regular strategic product review of your vision to ensure you stay aligned with your users’ needs.Have we learned anything new from our users that might impact the vision?Are we using the vision to guide our project decisions and next steps?What steps have we taken to turn our vision into reality?Are our efforts paying off?Do we need to pivot?Do we have the right people and skills to carry out our vision?Who can fill gaps or sponsor more resources?What challenges or risks are we facing? Do we need to make any trade-offs?Good luck on your journey to create a Meaningful Product Vision! Need help?

In this article, we’ll share how Faire developed a system for quantifying and prioritizing such inbound feedback. We hope that other product organizations looking to get the most out of customer feedback and frontline team inputs will find parts of our approach to be useful complements to (not a replacement for) their traditional prioritization processes.New customers, new opportunities to prioritizeAfter success in the US and Canada markets, Faire’s expansion into European markets in 2021 offered Faire brands the opportunity to connect with thousands of independent retailers across Europe. This expansion also introduced new and interesting challenges for our product teams. To ensure our French users had just as good of an experience as our American users, for example, we needed to address different preferences and needs across language, currency, payment methods, shipping carriers, support models, and more.With so many areas to improve the experience for our customers, our product team had a prioritization challenge. Since many of these opportunities required significant investments — such as payment or shipping vendor integrations over multiple quarters, or overhaul of the UX flows — it was important to ensure we were prioritizing the right opportunities. We needed a way to collect, organize, and evaluate multiple sources of customer feedback versus just listening to whichever account manager was advocating the loudest for their customer’s specific need.That’s how we ended up with our four-step process: (1) quantifiably collect the feedback, (2) categorize them into discrete root causes, (3) score each root cause on frequency, severity, and effort to fix, and (4) measure our progress.Step 1: Collect inbound feedback in a format that can be quantifiedAt the time, Faire had a variety of customer feedback — such as support form submissions, account management conversation notes, customer commentary from experience ratings, and much more. The key was making all this information easier to quantify and analyze in aggregate. Here are some ways we did that:Customer support requestsThe idea: help your customers help you — and get to the root of the issue faster. For example, when contacting Customer Support, our customers would previously enter order IDs as free form text or even screenshots. Although our support agents could work off of this level of info, our product team couldn’t analyze what type of orders had a higher propensity for customer issues. Therefore, we updated our support request form, making it easier for customers to choose from any of their past orders, while also making the data available for our product teams to analyze.Adding a rudimentary order picker instead of just open text can make the support form more convenient for your customer and more analyzable for your team.Frontline feedbackPreviously, our account managers and CX team members would share feedback with the product team by Slacking product managers directly. Although it was very collaborative, it wasn’t scaleable and didn’t allow us to objectively measure all the feedback we were collecting. Today, all of our frontline teams share feedback in a centralized tool which helps our product teams search for tags and keywords, as well as build alerts and dashboards that quantify topics they care about (we use a tool called Chattermill).Step 2: Consolidate each piece of feedback into a discrete root causeSpeaking of tags and keywords, that’s the key second step: drilling down into the root cause of each issue and tagging it correctly. For example, if an order is delayed, it could be due to multiple causes: the brand (seller) being out of stock, the shipping carrier being slow, the package being stuck at customs, or something else entirely.Getting to the discrete root cause of an issue requires truth-seeking rigor and collaboration, an important cultural value we practice at Faire. Given the complexity of our marketplace business, it’s best not to rely on metrics alone. In order to truly serve our community of customers, our product managers read support tickets to get a better understanding of who the customer is, what friction they felt, how it felt for them, and how to ultimately connect this information back to the product experience. Obviously, PMs can’t read every ticket — that’s why it’s important to build a relationship with your frontline teams and truly listen to them. They can advise your product teams on which tickets to read, can help curate tickets, and help identify common themes to translate a customer’s painful experience into a generalizable root cause.Through this process, our teams have been able to distill tens of thousands of seemingly discrete pieces of feedback into a list of about 100 clear opportunities to address.We organized thousands of free form feedback into a list of around 100 opportunity areas.Step 3: Score each root cause to prioritizeWhile a list of around 100 opportunities can be prioritized more easily than thousands of free form feedback, it’s still too many to prioritize intuitively. That’s where our pain score framework came in, which helped us measure both the severity and the frequency of a root cause.We pulled our frequency measurements from our quantifiable feedback (step 1). Also, for certain root causes (and symptoms), like packages getting stuck at borders, we could just count them. To be clear, “just counting” took operationalizing a special report with all our carriers, but we found these instrumentation investments to be worthwhile in honing our prioritization process.Severity is harder to measure. We started with a subjective grading rubric and assigned scores to each root cause manually. More recently, our Data Science team’s causality model has helped us more precisely define severity as “how much a particular incident reduces the probability of the customer coming back to order again.”Finally, we divide the pain score by the effort to solve the root cause (another subject rubric) to arrive at Pain Score ROI.This equation helped us identify where we can make the most impact today. By sequencing our roadmap starting with the highest Pain Score ROI project and ending with the lowest, we have been able to improve our European customer satisfaction as quickly as possible with our available resources.Consolidated root causes with their Pain Score ROI calculations.Step 4: Measure progressMeasuring progress is critical to ensuring your system is working. We measured progress holistically across three types of metrics:Feedback frequency and severity: Inbound feedback related to the particular root cause should decrease. This may be in the form of a reduction in frequency (fewer support contacts) or a reduction in severity (customers are less frustrated when they do contact). Again, we were able to monitor this because steps 1 and 2 ensured we could quantify these consolidated root causes.Product adoption: Solving a root cause usually meant improving the underlying product experience or even launching a new product. For example, when Faire improved the reliability of our system that generates shipping labels for our brands in Europe, we saw a dramatic increase in brands using our shipping labels rather than working directly with shipping carriers.Downstream business metrics: Although often hard to measure, the downstream business metrics should improve as well. For example, when we enabled our European brands to manage their catalogs in multiple currencies, we saw them optimize their listing prices more effectively — which subsequently helped them get more orders.When these metrics didn’t move, we went back to tune our assumptions. We noticed that we estimated the frequency and severity well enough, but underestimated the effort required to solve. For example, we thought one solution would solve the pain point or issue, when the root cause, but instead a series of several complementary solutions were required — necessitating a bit of grit to fully address the underlying customer pain.Measurable results — and moreOverall, in less than a year of operationalizing this new prioritization approach, we saw over 30% reduction in support contacts and a significant increase in customer satisfaction in blind surveys, where European customers rated Faire as the smoothest experience among all wholesale marketplaces.In addition to customer benefits, we’ve also seen an increase in our support and account management teams’ satisfaction. This feedback process allows them to more clearly see the impact their work has in helping improve our customer experience, and enables them to focus on more complex customer challenges.Given the positive impact we’ve already seen on both our customers and internal teams, our product team will continue to find ways to deepen our customer feedback channels, so we can ensure we’re prioritizing the tools and products that will help our customers succeed.Curious about what it’s like to work for a world-class product team?

Then, I used Paint to design my background and header.Finally, I cracked HTML with a little help from Google and my unique ‘Rainbow themed’ store with sorted products was born. I felt like a pro!Screenshot of a marine-themed Neopets store.(2) Zoo Tycoon — business sense, user-centric mindsetWhen I was 12, a friend introduced me to Zoo Tycoon, a PC game to build and run a zoo. I became so obsessed that my mom bought me the CD-ROM.A simulation game that gives a limited budget to achieve revenue goals to pass levels clearly boosts a child’s basic business sense.In this game, players must carefully decide which animals and amenities to add to their portfolio since they have different attractiveness and costs.The graphics, storyline and UI were extremely good and addictive. Kudos to the developers!In particular, two specific Zoo Tycoon features trained me to consider users at the center of my work:Each species has different needs when building installations. Design factors like space, rock and soil types, impact animals’ happiness.Visitors’ behavior and feedback inform zoo adjustments. E.g. Visitors complain and throw trash if there aren’t enough garbage bins.Gazelles giving positive reviews for their habitat!(3) Legos — storytelling, creativityMy relatives witnessed my love for building ‘amusement parks’, ‘race tracks,’ etc. with physical materials and presenting feature demos.Particularly, the challenge was fun if I had to use boxes, rulers, caps, and other random objects at grandma’s house if I didn’t bring Legos.Not having Legos meant limited resources. I found creative ways to build things.(4) Inventing games — user story writing, written communicationLast but not least, I was naturally attracted to writing and thinking about different scenarios since I was seven years old.For some peculiar reason, I would spend hours writing instructions and detailed explanations of invented games to share with friends. No wonder I now enjoy writing specs and documentation when needed!If you reached the end of this article, thank you!Childhood memories are a rich source of insights for finding purpose.I hope more people do this mental exercise and become aware of the impact of ‘fun activities’ on children’s potential professional future.Product ManagementProduct Management SkillsProduct Management Career----More from Carolina ChangFollowProduct ManagerLove podcasts or audiobooks?

81,5-vertical-saas-predictions-for-2023,https://www.medium.com/@verticalsaas/5-vertical-saas-predictions-for-2023-7c2b691d0b73?source=topics_v2---------200-84--------------------04bcbe07_c9bb_4c04_a9c1_aae6ece02a3a-------17,"5 Vertical SaaS Predictions for 2023 | by Fractal Software | Dec, 2022 | MediumFractal SoftwareFollowDec 15·4 min read5 Vertical SaaS Predictions for 2023As 2022 draws to a close, it’s worth reflecting on how extraordinary — and truly unpredictable — the past 12 months have been for investors and operators in the vertical SaaS space. We saw public markets tumble into bear market territory from their all-time-highs in late 2021, but despite these strong headwinds public vertical SaaS companies are still above their pre-pandemic highs on average. VC deployment has slowed dramatically, but vertical SaaS — particularly early stage companies — continue to command a premium in private markets. We’ve seen fewer companies go public as they wait for better macro conditions, but the number of vertical SaaS unicorns has swelled by 40% just in the past year.Much of this activity would have been difficult to predict in 2021. While some of last year’s predictions for the future of vertical SaaS have held up well, including a growing appetite for vertical SaaS in deep tech and an explosion of verticalized financial services, we learned first hand that Nobel physicist Neils Bohr was correct when he said, “prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future.” Still, we’ve once again decided to throw caution to the wind and asked our colleagues at Fractal what they think 2023 has in store. This is what they saw in their crystal ball:1. Larger ACVs for New Vertical SaaS Companies Compared to IncumbentsThe idea behind this prediction is simple: the solutions offered by new vertical SaaS entrants are far superior to the solutions of legacy incumbents. At Fractal, we’ve already seen the ACVs for our portfolio companies dramatically surpass our preliminary estimates, indicating a deep demand for better software across a broad range of industries. Bigger picture, this means the TAM for many verticals is significantly bigger than it looks on the surface and the vertical SaaS opportunity is even more attractive than expected. (Ben Marans, Associate)2. More Low-Code/No-Code Vertical SaaS ToolingThe primary benefits of low-code/no-code tools are reducing deployment time for applications by taking a “drag-and-drop” approach to software development and offering high levels of customization that traditional third-party SaaS applications cannot match. While low-code/no-code tools have made significant inroads into many areas of software (particularly web development), vertical-specific products in this category are relatively scarce. This is starting to change with the advent of tools such as PatternBuilder (legal SaaS document creation). We can expect to see significantly more low-code/no-code tools with a vertical focus in the coming years, especially in multi-vertical sectors like healthcare and legal services. (JP Gschwind, Principal)3. More Tech-enabled Services Layered into Workflow SaaS ProductsVertical SaaS companies have a number of TAM expansion techniques at their disposal that range from embedded fintech products to adjacent customer bases and more. In the future, we can expect more vertical SaaS companies to layer tech-enabled services onto their core SaaS offering to provide additional value to the customer and to expand their TAM. Revenue cycle management (RCM) is already a common example of this model in healthcare SaaS. Many practice management / electronic medical record (EMR) SaaS vendors offer RCM services on top of their core SaaS product and in some cases RCM contributes more to their ACV than the SaaS revenue. This allows practice management / EMR vendors to own an even larger share of their customer’s external vendor spend than a SaaS-only model and helps them solve an additional customer pain point, which makes their relationship with the customer more durable. However, this strategy comes with downsides: tech-enabled services generally represent lower margin, less predictable revenue than the traditional SaaS business model. (JP Gschwind, Principal)4. AI Tools Like GPT-3 Will Transform Vertical SaaSOver the past 12 months, we’ve witnessed the incredible power of large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-3, which can produce various kinds of text (e.g., articles or code) based on simple prompts. While this technology is by no means perfect — especially when it comes to writing functional code — it’s clear that as it improves, it will disrupt many industries, including vertical SaaS. One possible outcome is that it will turn vertical SaaS into headless databases of structured data that people can query with increasingly complex requests in natural language. For example, imagine a contractor using a vertical SaaS platform running GPT-3 will be able to verbally issue a command like “When our foremen hit their 1 year anniversary, send them an email.” The AI is not only able to figure out what a foreman and 1 year anniversary is based on the data, but also the text to put into the email. This future could be here sooner than we think. (Martin Kess, Head of Engineering)5. More Verticalized MiddlewareOver the past year, we’ve witnessed a remarkable growth in verticalized middleware, or software that acts as the connective tissue between applications and/or data. The rise of verticalized middleware speaks to the proliferation of a variety of different software solutions, horizontal and vertical, in the tech stack of a typical business. Vertical middleware helps specific industries effectively manage these solutions from a common platform. As more and more applications are built that cater to specific industries, there is the risk that vertical SaaS experiences the same “app overload” horizontal SaaS users experience by having to juggle multiple applications throughout their workflow process. Middleware is an effective solution to this problem and also a lucrative niche for vertical SaaS companies. Expect to see a lot more of it in the not-too-distant future.

Desire outcomes don’t materialise and we have emergent ideas. What the literature suggests though is that great leaders are able to periodically align the entire organisation on current and future strategy to ensure the whole company is pulling in the same direction. I’ve had this personal experience when working at a leading publisher. As we were competing on multiple fronts our core proposition expanded to include digital and services. The question then was what exactly is our core strategy? Are we still a publisher with additional business streams or are we a publishing, digital and services business? After much thought the business aligned on their new strategy where they double-downed on their historical position as the leading publisher with a view to outsourcing/partnering work related to digital and services. The point here is not to discuss whether their strategy was right or not but to stress the need to refresh company strategy periodically.StrategyStartupProduct ManagementProduct Strategy----More from Arfan IsmailFollowLove podcasts or audiobooks?

The coach gives a rousing speech. The game plan is laid out, and each player knows exactly what they have to do. But the real test begins as the game kicks off.Photo by Fancy Crave on UnsplashThe players must work together to execute their first move. Despite their best effort, the attempt is met with failure: the opposing team surprises with an unexpected play and the team is forced to change their plans.Now they must hope for a little luck and collaborate flawlessly. They push forward, building up an attack after an attack, determined to find a way. Time is running out and the pressure is on.Then suddenly an opening appears: perfect insight, perfect build up, perfect execution and the team is able to seize the opportunity. The opponent is outplayed and the team emerges victorious.”While this might sound like football, this is also product development.Pressure to deliver, changing tactics as the situation unfolds and working hard as a team towards those elusive goals — football and product development have a lot in common.While football teams try to win championships by scoring goals, product teams aim to win markets by building solutions users need.The game rules might be different, but football can serve as a source of inspiration for anyone looking to improve teamwork, planning, agility and goal setting in the product organization.Even a star player can’t score aloneIf you would put Messi alone on the field against France, would he win? What if he had 2 other players with him? Even the most talented individuals are unlikely to score against a fully functional team.The team not only has to be complete, it also has to include different skills and roles working in perfect unity. One person may end up scoring, but behind him are the efforts of 10 other people setting the play up.In product organization too it may look like it’s a small fraction of people in the spotlight, but there is vast amounts of teamwork behind every success.Fragments alone won’t make a wholeCould you imagine a game if midfielders never pass the ball, goalie is trying to score, attacker is running in the wrong direction and coach is giving directions only to the star player?Photo by Prapoth Panchuea on UnsplashSome misalignments in teamwork are common — not each pass is successful in professional football either — but the more bits of the system malfunction, the harder it is to play a coherent game with a successful outcome.Leadership, product managers, designers, engineers, researchers, analysts, marketers and customer facing teams need not only to align the objectives of the work, but also the ways of working: how different functions operate, do handovers and collaborate.If individual functions work in silos without cooperation, balls get lost, attacks fail and defense crumbles.Building ability to adapt instead of detailed plans“Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth” — Mike TysonGreat teams go out on the field with a game plan, but they don’t try to plan everything ahead.Imagine the head coach of Argentina announcing minutes before the game that they will be scoring 3 goals: on minutes 16, 42 and 76. They have every move planned out so no one can score against them. And that’s how they win.Sometimes product teams (are expected to) do that: outline and predict each step and outcome of those steps in advance. And then be surprised and feel like failures if things don’t work out.Photo by Omar Ram on UnsplashJust like football teams know to expect the unexpected plays, injuries and red cards, product teams should not be surprised when the market or product strategy evolves, available resources shift or customer feedback isn’t only praise.It is impossible to know ahead how the game will exactly unfold and the coach can not be there on the field making all the moves. Great teams are prepared for changes: trained to make decisions on the go and adapt tactics as the circumstances become clearer.Success is not guaranteed, but with the right preparation…​​In the FIFA World Cup 2022, Morocco was the first African nation to get into the semi-finals. Morocco’s success may have been the best underdog story of the tournament, but it was not a result of luck, but strategy and preparation.Some of the most critical work happens before the games: team building, learning various plays, studying opponents and strategizing.Photo by Gustavo Ferreira on UnsplashWith thousands of game plays possible and practiced, developing a strategy means making a deliberate choice between different options considering the current strengths of the team and the weaknesses of the opponents.Morocco’s strength and strategy was their defense and until the semi-finals no one was able to push through — not even Spain, one of the eight national teams to have ever been crowned a world champion. Winning is not guaranteed even for the winners.For product organizations it is the same: continuous learning, teambuilding and strategizing matters every time the teams go out to deliver — no matter how they have done in the past. One goal does not make a champion, but good preparation can improve the chances even against a stronger competitor.Most goals are preceded with failed attemptsEven with great players, teamwork, strategy and preparation in place, a team may have to take several shots at a goal before they score. In the 2018 World Cup finals, France took 8 shots, but successfully scored only 4. That means even the world champions missed half of the shots they took.Photo by Omar Ram on UnsplashThe same is true for the product teams: the first solution to a problem might not be enough. That is why smart product organizations leave room in their plans and try again until they succeed or time runs out. Missing shots does not make a bad team, it is part of the game.One more thing about numbers: In the same World Cup final that France won 4–2, they possessed the ball only 39% of the time and got more yellow cards than their opponent. Let’s keep in mind in product as well that leading metrics are indicators that don’t tell the full story of performance, only some parts of it.Inspiration can come from anywhereIt is difficult to build a successful product without building an effective product organization.Even though football’s game rules are different from product development, there are things to learn from the sport about teamwork, planning, agility and goal setting.Not expecting a star player to deliver alone — Even the most talented people will not succeed unless they are backed up by a team.Integrating individual functions into one coherent team — Different parts of the team need not only to align on the objectives but also how they work together.Building ability to adapt instead of making detailed plans — It is impossible to predict how games will go. Great teams are trained to adapt tactics as the circumstances become clearer.Preparing to improve the chances of success — Winning is not guaranteed, but good preparation increases the odds.Not being surprised by failures — even the best teams may need multiple attempts at a goal before they successfully score.Football is not only an interesting game, it is a source of inspiration.—What are some other similarities you’ve noticed between football and product development?ProductProduct DevelopmentProduct ManagementFootball----More from Maret KruveFollowProduct person with design and development background.Love podcasts or audiobooks?

Scrum proposes 5 Events, 3 Account-abilities, 3 Artifacts and 5 values. Scrum is offering set of general principles that an organisation can adapt and work to improve the efficiency of the team.Altering the Order of Scrum EventsScrum events are purposefully arranged in the sequence. Output of the each event shall contribute to conduct the next event of the Scrum and help the team to analyse, identify improvements/mistakes and adapt the learning.For an instance, If the Sprint retrospection of the current sprint is conducted after the Sprint Plan of upcoming, the team cannot adapt / plan for the learning / improvements from the current sprint. Similarly, If the Retrospection is conducted before Sprint review, the team don’t even have the input to conduct the retrospection properly.“If the team is not having any impact even if the sequence of the scrum events are changed, then the team is not following the scrum process”It is high time for the scrum master to guide the team and educate the proper way of doing scrum2. Conducting meeting with Unclear AgendaEach Scrum event has it’s own agenda and the team should follow it strictly. For an instance, Daily calls are not just to update “What I have done yesterday?”, “What is my plan for today?” & “Impediments”. The Team should always track their progress towards the sprint goal and make sure that the committed goal are not spilled over.Similarly, Sprint review is not only to just demo / review the increment. The team should also discuss with the stakeholders, get the review on the increments and get the updates about the Market trends. Also the team should discuss on the upcoming plans in the Product.The team should not split the meetings. For example, Sprint planning is conducted to inspect the product backlog, pick the items which are ready for the development ,discuss the required information with the team members, estimate the Story/Feature and assign it to a developer. All the agenda should be covered in the same meeting and time limits should be followed.3. Not involving the required ParticipantsAs displayed in the Picture under point 2, each Scrum event has its own agenda and set of audience. For example, Sprint Review should have the Scrum team and the required stakeholders. Meeting without the Stakeholders is useless.ScrumAgileScrum EventsScrumorgProduct Management----More from Jawahar JothilingamFollowProfessional Scrum Product Owner | Agile PractitionerLove podcasts or audiobooks?

Stop Adding Features to your Product… | by rachelle palmer | Dec, 2022 | Mediumrachelle palmerFollowDec 16·3 min readThis Pie Tastes Like ShitN+1 Features are Ruining Our ProductsOnce upon a time there was a product. The product was good, maybe even great, and it was simple. It got the job done. It was maybe, mostly, ‘no frills’. And thousands, tens of thousands, of people ate it up. It was sort of like Pumpkin Pie. There’s nothing wrong with pumpkin pie — it’s friggin great. Every year Costco sells about 2.5 million pumpkin pies at Thanksgiving, and each one of those is about $6. That’s a nice slice of revenue for a humble orange thing. Of course, not everyone loves pumpkin pie.Photo by Diliara Garifullina on UnsplashBack to your product. Someday, sometime, probably today as I’m typing this, there is someone saying something to you. It’s goes like this:But what about all those people who want pineapple upside down cake?Pineapple is delicious, and cake is delicious, and if we just had one of those, we’d make even more money! Imagine how much more money!And you, diligent and useful person that you are, proceed to do the only logical thing. You add pineapple upside down cake to the menu.Oh wait. Let me be entirely specific, you added pineapple upside down cake to your pumpkin pie. Another feature. Right on top, like a yuletide bow, and now things are looking pretty festive around here.But there is a little uncertainty with your launch. New users suddenly want to know what this (thing) does? who is this for? what’s the use case? Of course, there’s an answer to this question and its a simple one. The pie is great, even more great than before! And there are weirdos in the world who like pumpkin pineapple pie, so you do have advocates for the product revision. This! , they say, should be the new normal! Loyal customers don’t say much — they can still see the pumpkin underneath so no worries. Satisfied, you carry on.Then a different person shows up on your doorstep. This is the person who formerly bought the most pumpkin pies, and he’s now threatening to churn to another store because your pie sucks, and what he really wanted was peanut butter. He’s been asking for years for peanut butter, and now you’ve gone and added pineapple and that just shows you dont even care.You: Ok ok ok, we will add peanut butter.Dutifully slop that right on there, quick and dirty. Done.Market research: there’s something about strawberries… we’d like to tease this out with some more user interviewsThe cooks (engineers), whose code is a spaghetti pile:Your marketing team asks no questions because you’re an innovator. They hit the streets with a compelling and classy branded whitepaper extolling the awesomeness of pumpkin pineapple peanut butter pie.Customers: Geezus all we wanted is a pumpkin pie this place strategically really does not align with us and what are they always talking about new and modernYour competition: we have simple, straightforward pumpkin pie right hereYour other competition: with whipped cream. We cater to the traditional business. Those guys are edge case.Your sales team: can you do something please we are getting murdered out hereYou: bananas.Customer: this is inedible garbageYou, desperate: Did you know that carrot cake is good for you?Customer: FOAD…..Why am I telling you this story?Because this is how many products are managed. Just like this, our perfectly functional products grow into ghastly monsters, layered with bells and whistles until all they are is a nonsensical jumble of shit, suitable for only ten people in the world.In the attempt to be all things to all people, they end up being incompatible with the masses. They confuse more than they enable.There’s a simple solution to this. Stop.Take a breath.Then ask yourself if what your product needs to be the pumpkin pineapple peanut butter pie… or just three pies. It’s breathtakingly simple. And simple, my friends, sells.Product ManagementProduct DevelopmentAgileProgrammingSoftware Development----More from rachelle palmerFollowData Informed Decision Maker. Product Leader@MongoDB.

But if you listen, you may learn something new.” ― The Dalai LamaIllustration by Dinos&Teacups from DribbleHave you just joined a new team or a company? Or are you setting up a new function from scratch and you are looking for ways to deepen your knowledge about the company, business, product, and people, so that you can strategise yourself and position your function accordingly to solve real problems and uncover opportunities? Then there is one great tool that can help you get started: The listening tour.This one tool helped me a lot to identify high impact opportunities while setting up a product ops function for a product portfolio company, so I wanted to share some tips and tricks that will hopefully be helpful for you too.What is a listening tour?The listening tour is mainly structured as a series of interviews to listen to people, get to know one another on a personal level to start establishing trust and empathy, all the while getting an understanding of what the person does and the inner workings of a team, function or company, along with what works well, what can be improved and how you (your role or team) can support them and work well together.When taking on a new challenge, it is always great to bring our previous experiences and look at the best practices across the industry. The most important thing is to blend those with the actual needs of individuals and organisations to design the solutions that fits best to our new specific context, because every person and organisation is in some way unique and different from the other, even if they have some traits in common. The listening tour enables us to do exactly that, i.e. to understand these unique needs.How to conduct oneAs it is with everything, it is very helpful to plan ahead and make the necessary preparation in order to get the most out of the insights you’ll gather from the listening tour. So let’s take a look at what to cover in each major step.Before the interviews→ First of all start with defining what you would like to learn and what you would like to achieve by going on a listening tour, and based on this define your scope. For example, you might be looking to get insights on a specific topic, such as how we currently manage release notes as the product team and how it affects customers and customer facing teams. You could also rather keep it a bit more open, like to understand what the current operational pain points in the product team are and how that impacts collaboration with other departments.→ Based on your goal, identify the team members and stakeholders to interview. This step is really important as it will shape the insights you will gather. As you need all the different perspectives to draw the full picture, the best is to think about all the people and functions you and your team interacts with or should be interacting with. For example, while setting up the product ops function, it was important not only to understand the inner workings of the product teams, but it was also crucial to understand how they work with other teams be it legal, documentation, customer success, sales, learning and development, and many more as it takes a village to create the best possible experience for the customers and to bring value to the business. So make sure to have representatives from all the necessary stakeholder groups on your interviewee list. If you already have your stakeholder map that’s already a great starting point for your list. If not this will be the perfect opportunity to start building one.At some point you might realise that you have way too many people on your list to interview (as we did!) given the limited time and resources you have. In this case start with a simple prioritisation (primary and secondary) as we always do with everything and try to cover the primary stakeholders first and then go through the secondary ones if you still have the time.→ Prepare base themes you would like to cover together with some guiding questions: Remember that these will just serve as a conversation facilitator where your dialogue will take things forward. So you should have the flexibility to discuss some topics in more detail where you might even find yourself exploring some other aspects that you haven’t even initially had in mind. In this case you might want to discuss these newfound topics with the other interviewees down the line as well. While doing that also make sure to cover the same base themes and topics to find patterns in the answers. On top of all these, as a principle try to use open ended questions to learn more about people’s experiences, thoughts and feelings.Here’s an example outline for the interview structure including potential themes and topics to cover along with some guiding questions for inspiration which you can use and build upon based on your needs.IntroMeet & greet, review the goal and agenda.Tell me about yourself and your personal story at the company.Tell me about your role and your current team.Deeper DivesWhat are your current touch points with team [x]?How is the current collaboration and communication?What are your dependencies to each other and how are they managed currently?What works well?What is challenging or can be better?Which topics do you think would need immediate attention from me or my team?Closing ThoughtsDo you have any additional thoughts or comments?Who else would you recommend that I should be connecting with?Next StepsSay thank you, share and explain what people can expect as an outcome of this conversation, if and how you will engage with them in the future and what will happen afterwards to manage expectations.Define the appropriate duration for your interviews:From experience, I can say that make sure that your sessions are at least for 40 mins as anything below that is just too short to get acquainted and dive into topics. Also feel free to set up follow-up sessions if needed.→ Pre-interview communication: Before sending the interview invites, get in touch with the interviewees to say hi, introduce yourself if you haven’t met/e-met yet and give a heads up about the upcoming meeting request they will get together with its intent so that they are fully onboard and at ease. Doing it via Slack worked the best for me as it is a bit more laid back.→ Send the interview invite: Make sure that you give an explanatory but chill title. I try to make it a bit more amicable by naming it as “ [topic] chat ☕” to come off warmer and more friendly and that people don’t feel like they are going to be interrogated. Make sure to add adequate information in the description again explaining its goal, what they can expect and how they can get prepared for it.→ Keep in mind that the best is to meet on a 1–1 basis: It helps to have deeper and more open conversations, but be flexible if people would prefer to hold these meetings in groups. If this is the case just adjust the meeting duration accordingly.During the interviews→ Make sure that you take meeting notes so that you capture all the important insights and that nothing falls between the cracks. Depending on your context you might also want to run the interviews with one of your team members. In this case it might be good to split the roles where one moderates and the other focuses on taking notes and that you discuss learnings together afterwards.After the interviews→ Right after each interview, directly unpack what you’ve heard. It is best to do it right after the meeting rather than the following day or later because people tend to forget approximately 50 percent of the information they receive the next day if not rehearsed right afterwards based on the Ebbinghaus’s Forgetting Curve. As you might already be familiar from my previous articles, I’m a big fan of Miro and that’s the tool I chose to gather the key insights and do affinity mapping (clustering) over time. After a couple of interviews, it is super exciting to see that some buckets start forming around the same topics.→ After completing the interviews, analyse and synthesise those findings. You can do that in different ways. If you need the contribution and the buy-in of your key stakeholders, then you might think of having a workshop with them to analyse the insights and define the next steps together. For example, if you are setting up a new function, then it might be helpful to involve the leadership for prioritising focus areas and defining the strategy. You can also just analyse and define next steps by yourself if the scope is only relevant to you, for example if your aim is to understand how your new team functions and what the needs of your different team members are.→ Regardless of the way you choose to analyse and define the next steps, always share your findings and plans (assuming that you’ll plan some action items or projects based on the outcomes of your listening tour) with interviewees afterwards as their work might be dependent on you and your work or they might just be interested in the outcome for better alignment. You can either do it via a detailed report and share it via email or if the topic is more private then you can just try to cover them in your 1–1s.As you’ve uncovered all the amazing insights, synthesised them and came up with an action plan now it is the time to make them happen!As we are getting closer to the end of the year, please also make the time to listen to yourself, reflect on the past year, see what you would like to achieve and where would you like to be personally next year to plan and take the necessary steps to get there!Here’s to learning more about ourselves and others around us, which will help us shape the best possible future!Referenceshttps://fellow.app/blog/management/how-to-conduct-a-successful-listening-tour-example-questions/https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/my-experience-with-listening-tours-f523c5120d29Product ops summit presentation by Shira Baumanhttps://www.growthengineering.co.uk/what-is-the-forgetting-curve/https://delvetool.com/blog/semi-structuredhttps://www.enablemententhusiast.com/post/the-ultimate-listening-tourProduct OpsProduct ManagementListeningDiscoveryListening Tour----More from BootcampFollowFrom idea to product, one lesson at a time.

You may even be a Product Manager who realized what you thought would work doesn’t. The good news is you are not alone. While some Product Managers are exceptional at what they do — most Product Managers really don’t know what they are doing.Hi, my name is Adam Root. I’d like to teach you how to be an exceptional Product Manager for free.To get started I would like to zoom out on how I arrived at the conclusion to create a Free Product Management Course. After co-founding a funded startup, working as a venture capitalist in San Francisco, and leading Product Management efforts for public and private companies, I have learned the hard way how to build products users love.When I was building my first product team I tried teaching new product managers what I had in my head, but it just didn’t work. Like most people that have been doing something for nearly two decades a lot of what I did was just “automatic.”It would be similar to teaching someone how to drive after you have been driving for many years. When you were first learning to drive remember how many steps there were? Do you remember how much concentration you needed to apply the steps in the right order? If you have been driving awhile you probably drive while texting, drinking coffee, and checking your social media accounts. I hope you don’t, but most people do. Maybe after a long day you drove home and couldn’t remember how you even arrived. The point is when you first started driving versus now is a very different experience.Like driving, I forgot to teach or even mention so many steps that are crucial for those who were just learning. Not because I didn’t want to, it was just “automatic” to me. As a result, teaching Product Management “on the job” just wasn’t working. Product Managers on my team became confused, overwhelmed, and frustrated. Products didn’t ship and stakeholders were not happy. I tried a new approach.I scoured the web, completed courses, read books and had Product Managers on my team do the same. Sadly, I was once again frustrated by failure. Product Managers on my team were agitated.Overwhelmed, I was starting to think that maybe I should abandon the people management career path and focus on being a Principal Product Manager.Luckily I had several mentors encourage me. Fast forward a couple of years and eventually after a lot of trial an error and lot of patience from my team I was able to create a v1 of a Product Management training curriculum that finally seemed to garner results. Up until recently I hadn’t shared the course publicly. Not because I didn’t want to. I did. It was always one of those things I would do “someday.”Zoom into today. In my current role it became necessary given resources and time constraints to scale and evolve what has been cobbled together in Confluence pages into a more formalized curriculum. I thought it best to share the course for free with all aspiring Product Managers on medium.My hope is my Product Manager peers have some great ideas I missed or maybe better ways of doing things. If you are currently a product management team leader like a Group Product Manager or Director of Product Management at your company I’d love it if you can weigh in with approaches that have worked for you. Additionally, if you have been a Product Manager for awhile and have had some successful products shipped (with a title of Principal Product Manager or Sr. Product Manager) I would hope you will help aspiring Product Managers accelerate their learnings by adding your additions, deletions, or comments on the course. With that context let’s get started on this journey together.Why Create Another Approach to Digital Innovation?If you read the background section you have the context for why I created this course, but I liked to provide a little more data here. If you didn’t read the background section than I’ll summarize my findings with this statement more bluntly:The US spends $250B per year on software development, with the average cost of development per project being $2.3MM for a large company, and $430K for a small company. 31% of applications were never completed, and 52% were nearly double the cost than anticipated. In fact, only 16% were completed on-time and on-budget. source: report by The Standish GroupSo if you are lucky enough to be in the minority of Product Managers that have built applications with product/market fit, my assumption is that your product likely shipped later than expected, had excessive stakeholder compromises and cost more to ship than you originally anticipated- even if it did achieve the outcomes you set for the product.So how do we fix this broken system? Customer Development, Design Thinking, Northstar, Jobs to Be Done, Circles, Lean etc? In my opinion, those frameworks and some others are excellent and they do provide some value. However, none of them are the “silver bullet” I hoped for and likely missing things you need too. Still, if you are aspiring to be a Product Manager I do think there is value in spending some time to learn the current thinking out in the market on some books and courses. The books, and courses I believe provide value and are worthing spending time on are below.While all the above resources are beneficial (I do recommend you get them, and read them, or complete the courses if only to be familiar with what you will hear in your career) all of them by themselves fall short in preparing you for a career in Product Management. I strongly believe frameworks implemented in the past has caused a sea of dead startups, lost invested capital and/or shareholder value, and ethically questionable business practices. (e.g. Facebook’s 21 scandals in 2018 alone.)My goal in this course is to teach the necessary mindset, tactical execution, provide solutions to overcome common barriers you will encounter, team member roles you will work with, and stakeholder management practices you will need to ensure your product is built without compromising the integrity needed to gain market adoption. For sake of brevity I will refer to this approach in the rest of the series as ADVANCE™.ADVANCE™ Program OverviewADVANCE™ is a Free Product Management Course intended to accelerate aspiring Product Managers with career ready digital innovation.ADVANCE™ is an acronym created as a mnemonic device to simplify remembering and communicating its complexity. The curriculum contains nine sections. Seven of the nine sections are the core curriculum and should be completed in sequential order. The course also includes two additional sections 1) Course Introduction, and 2) Capstone project.Each of the seven core curriculum includes a lesson covering the theoretical knowledge of the material, a case study providing an example of material in the world, and an assignment to convert theory into practical skills.For as long as I am able to, I will personally grade “officially registered students” assignments. To register for the official ADVANCE™ Free Product Management Course complete the steps outlined in the Registration Steps section below. Once you complete the entire course, including passing all lessons and a Capstone Project you will either receive a certificate of completion (which can be shared on Linkedin) and/or a personal recommendation from me on LinkedIn.Course Registration StepsTo officially “enroll” in this Free Product Management course, and be entitled to alumni benefits you will need to complete the following:Subscribe to my newsletter. Subscribing to Product Management Parchment will grant you access to apply to private (non-public) product manager jobs, access to exclusive networking events (in-person and online), and subscriber only material. To do so, Click the Subscribe bell icon next to my profile photo.Connect on Linkedin. At time of publishing I have over 15,000 connections. LinkedIn limits connections for individuals to 25,000 connections. If I do not have connections available, “Follow Me” instead and send an Inmail. My LinkedIn profile is open which means you can send an Inmail to me for free. In your connection request, or Inmail state that you are “registering” for the Free Product Management course.Join the course Discord server called Free Product Management Course. Joining the Discord server will enable you to ask other students questions on the lesson’s assignment, or ask me directly for help. Additionally, I post job opportunities to the Discord server before I send them in the my newsletter. Upon joining you will be assigned to a cohort channel. Each cohort lasts 90 days. If you do not graduate in 90 days, but are still actively learning, you can request to be added to a new cohort channel. Upon graduating the course you be added to the alumni channel. The alumni channel is a great networking opportunity if you are seeking a job in Product Management or looking to hire competent Product Managers.If you do not to “officially” register for the course, I would still appreciate feedback, comments or critiques. Please follow me on Twitter, and tag me in a tweet with the #FreeProductManagementCourse or send a Direct Message to me.ADVANCE™ (The Free Product Management Course) SyllabusThere are nine sections to the ADVANCE™ Free Product Management Course.Course Introduction: The first section of the course reviews several popular frameworks useful for digital innovation, a glossary of industry terms, the product development lifecycle and the composition of ADVANCE™ Digital Product team. Exposing each team members area of responsibilities, experience level, average salaries, and career progression path.Analyze the Market: Products that achieve Product Market Fit start with a comprehensive market-based strategy. In this section, students will learn techniques to analyze markets and the frequency the team needs to complete market analysis. Once completed, students will be able understand the role Business Analysts, and Product Managers play at the beginning of the product development lifecycle and how to communicate early findings to stakeholders.Determine Market Opportunities, and User Needs: The second lesson expands on the roles and deliverables needed early in the product development lifecycle. Including how these disciplines work with Product Managers to identify overlooked product opportunities hidden in a market analysis. Students will learn how to partner with these disciplines to generate artifacts such as personas, and user journeys to communicate user needs to stakeholders before pitching the product vision.Vet the Market: Once user needs and market opportunities have been defined, the ADVANCE Product Team works together with the Finance team to forecast a product’s potential returns. Students will learn how to create a proforma using a technique called “Bottom Up TAM Sizing.” Afterwards you will learn how to highlight your findings from this lesson and previous lessons by completing a Market Requirement Document (MRD). This section will conclude by teaching you how to summarize the salient points of the MRD with your team and with stakeholders.Assess Business Case: Now that you and your team have a completed MRD you need to assess the business case for your market. You will learn about business models and how to determine the right prospective models using the Business Model Canvas. After completing a Business Model Canvas, students will learn how to identify the most profitable monetization strategy and refine the previous lesson’s proforma. After refining the proforma, you will learn how to compare it to in market solutions in Buy vs Build analysis. The lesson concludes by determining if the team should build a solution, buy an in market solution, or a buy a solution and extending its functionality. Students will learn how to evaluate ideas as a meritocracy, instead of rewarding the loudest voices. Creating an environment where the ideas most likely to succeed in market is developed by combining a free personality test and Zoom plugin called Dot Collector.Narrow Hypothesis: Armed with user needs, marco trends, competitive insights, business models, financial forecasts, and a decision to buy, build, or buy and extend functionality students will learn to how to write a Product Requirement Document, plan out feature releases in their roadmap, and summarize their findings in a “Product Hub” on Confluence.Craft Product Vision and Pitch: In this lesson, you will use all of previous knowledge you have gained to summarize a narrative for stakeholders in a Product Vision, and frame it in a way that is easy for stakeholders to quickly understand its value to the organization and to users by creating a simple presentation. Students will learn how to pitch their product vision with confidence, and overcome stakeholder objections without alienating relationship capital. Lastly, students will update their Product Hub with key information stakeholders and team members can refer back during the life of the product- ensuring its integrity remains in tact.Empower your Team: After pitching your product vision, and securing approval to build your product Product Managers need to equip the team with detailed information to ensure the team knows what they need to build. In this lesson, students will learn about Scrum and Kanban frameworks, and determine which framework is ideal for their product roadmap. In addition, students will learn how to write user stories, tasks, bugs, spikes, and chores, collectively called tasks. Assign and group tasks into epics in Jira, and roll these epics into an organization’s mission statement using Advanced Roadmaps in Jira. Lastly, students will learn how to ensure tasks are completed on time and budget by utilizing reporting features in Jira, and how program managers can manage this process throughout a product’s lifecycle.Capstone Course: In the final assignment of the course, students will use everything they have learned to create a plan, collaborate with stakeholders Marketing, Sales, Customer Support, and the other teams to prepare them to interface with users as the product is launched. Execute the launch and use feedback from your customers to refine the Product Hub, and determine the next iteration for your product.I look forward to seeing you in the forums, and I am excited to see what we build together!

An outcome-based roadmap is a type of… | by Tim Hartnack | Dec, 2022 | MediumTim HartnackFollowDec 16·3 min readOutcome based product roadmapManagers want to make sure that everybody knows what the top priority is.I can totally share this need as it is crucial to know what is currently important. The first reflex is often to create a roadmap, which contains the most important projects of the future in a particular order. But a product roadmap does not only address the goal to know what is important now, but also what will be important after the first item and even what will be important in a couple of months.Additionally, to knowing what will be important in the future you also plan how to solve the problems of the future with your current knowledge. This suggest that you do not only have an idea what will be important in a couple of weeks but also how to tackle the problems of the future as classical roadmaps do not address the upcoming challenges but solutions instead.The problem of planning solutions ahead is that you cannot be sure that these solutions really match the problem. Hence with finishing the roadmap item you can totally celebrate releasing it, but you have no idea which problem is solved now. Without knowing which problem has been solved you cannot be sure that you have created any value. I prefer knowing the problem to solve instead of having a solution.Instead of using a roadmap full of assumptions of solutions, the better idea would be to have a roadmap full of problems you want to solve in the future. This way you can make sure everybody can focus on solving the most urgent problem.In his must-read book “Inspired” Marty Cagan says that such an outcome-based roadmap is “is all about solving problems, not implementing features” [1].An outcome-based roadmap does not state the next feature to implement but the next problem to solve. This way you do not only create real value, but you also have a possibility to measure your progress. Instead of measuring the delivery and accept upcoming work to get the feature to its full potential, you can be sure to deliver value from the very start.Hence instead of planning to have a newly styled onboarding page you should rather plan to achieve an increase of new customers, more customer satisfaction in the onboarding or easier onboarding for people with disabilities. That gives you and your team the chance to achieve the goal in the most propriate way and the most suitable technology available. Furthermore, you can easy check if the implementation you have chosen did have any impact on your goal. Instead of celebrating the release of a feature you can celebrate the increase of new customers. Which goal looks more valuable to you?In the phase of transition, it is tough to move from a classical project roadmap to an outcome-based roadmap in just one big step. But if you are looking for a low hanging fruit to the approach you can easily write down the purpose for any planned roadmap item. You can then use the known planning approach of a classical roadmap with additional goals to achieve and move slowly to an outcome-based roadmap.One of the key benefits of an outcome-based roadmap is that it helps to align the product development efforts with the overall business goals and strategies. By focusing on the desired outcomes, teams can make sure that they are working on the most important and impactful areas of the product. It can also help to ensure that resources are being used effectively and efficiently to achieve the desired outcomes.Additionally, it gives everybody on the company to fully understand why their work has an impact to the overall goal.[1] Marty Cagan, INSPIRED: How to Create Tech Products Customers LoveProduct ManagementRoadmapsAgile MethodologyProduct----More from Tim HartnackFollowEnthusiastic Agilist and Scrum Master.

However, in recent years, there has been a growing belief that product management is dying.https://www.linkedin.com/in/santudey/ Connect with me on LinkedinOne of the main reasons for this belief is the increasing use of agile development methodologies. Agile emphasizes collaboration and flexibility, and it allows for rapid iteration and experimentation. This can lead to a blurring of the lines between product management and other roles, such as engineering and design, making it difficult to clearly define the role of the product manager.Another reason is the increasing complexity of products and the challenges of managing them. As products become more sophisticated, it can be difficult for a single person to have a complete understanding of all aspects of the product. This can lead to a dilution of the product manager’s responsibilities, making it difficult for them to effectively oversee the product.Furthermore, the increasing pace of change in the business world means that product managers must be able to adapt quickly and be willing to try new things. This can be challenging for those who are used to more traditional approaches to product management, leading to a lack of interest in the role.Overall, while product management is not dying per se, it is evolving and changing. As the business world becomes more complex and dynamic, product managers must be able to adapt and stay relevant in order to continue to play a crucial role in organizations.5 Common Product Management MistakesProduct managers are responsible for ensuring the success of a product, from its initial concept to its launch and…medium.com16 Steller Product Blogs — The Top 1% Product Managers FollowYou can learn about product management by following the waymedium.comProduct ManagementProduct DevelopmentProduct DesignProductStartup----1More from BootcampFollowFrom idea to product, one lesson at a time.

It is something what you’ll do for sure… | by Jzfdvd | Dec, 2022 | MediumJzfdvdFollowDec 16·6 min readCompetitor AnalysisIt is something what you’ll do for sure if you are a product manager. There is no good recipe for competitor analysis in my toolset, but there are a few steps which help me as a guideline. They are as strong rules as the Pirate’s Code so take them as guides or advises only, but I’ll still share here what I regularly do. (Yes, repeatedly).The definition (~)Competitor analysis is the process of gathering and evaluating information about the competitors in order to understand their strengths and weaknesses, and to identify opportunities and threats to your business.What are the key tasks?Here are some steps I follow to do proper competitor analysis:Identify my product’s competitors. Start by identifying all the companies that compete with my product. This may include direct competitors that offer similar products or services, as well as indirect competitors that offer alternative solutions to the same problem.Gather information about the competitors. I gather as much information as I can about my product’s competitors. This may include their products and services, pricing, marketing strategies, target customers, and any other relevant information. I can gather this information through a variety of sources, including their website, social media profiles, press releases, and industry reports.Analyze the competitors’ strengths and weaknesses. I always analyze their strengths and weaknesses. This will help me understand where they excel and where they may be vulnerable, and will allow me to identify opportunities and threats to my product.Compare my business to the competitors’. I consider factors such as my exact products and services, pricing, marketing strategies, target customers, and overall competitive advantage.Develop a strategy. Based on the analysis, I develop a strategy to help my product to stay competitive in the market. This may involve adjusting the product or any of its services, pricing, marketing strategies, or targeting different customers.Monitor the competitors regularly. I constantly keep an eye on the competitors and their activities, and periodically review and update the comparison to ensure that I have a clear understanding of the competitive landscape.Let’s detail the above topics a bit more.Identify my product’s competitorsDefine my product’s market. Start by identifying the specific problem (or problems) that my product(s) solve(s). This will help me narrow down the pool of potential competitors and focus the search on companies that offer similar solutions.Search online. Use online search engines and industry databases (if any) to find companies that offer products or services similar to my product. Easy to start with like look for keywords related to my product and see what comes up in the search results. This seems off-grid here, but you’ll be surprised how many times you’ll be surprised after a couple of searches.Look for companies that serve the same customer needs. Identify the specific needs of the target customers and look for companies that serve those needs. As mentioned above this may include direct competitors that offer similar products or services, as well as indirect competitors that offer alternative solutions to the same problem.Analyze my own value proposition. I can’t emphasize this enough. Without knowing what I offer, I can’t win. I can’t even put a price tag on something I don’t know what it exactly is. So, here I build up the unique value proposition of my product and look for companies that offer similar value to their customers. This may include companies that have a similar target market, pricing strategy, or unique selling points. I use the Value Proposition Canvas technique which is part of the Business Model Canvas. If you have not heard of those, then I must say: Google is your friend :DAsk the customers. Ask my product’s customers or prospects where they go to find products or services similar to mine. This can be a valuable source of information and may help me identify competitors that I may not have considered otherwise. This is a kinda hard step especially in the B2B sector.Gather information about the competitorsWhat I perform in this phase:Market position. Consider the market position of each of the competitors. This includes their size, market share, and overall industry presence. This will help me understand the relative strength of each competitor and how they compare to my offerings.Products and services. Analyze the products and services offered by the competitors, including their features, benefits, and pricing. This will help me understand what makes each competitor’s offerings unique and how they compare to my own products and services.Marketing strategies. Analyze the marketing strategies of the competitors, including the channels they use to reach their target customers, their overall brand positioning, and any promotional tactics they use. This will help me understand how the competitors are promoting their products and services and how I can differentiate my product in the market.Online presence. Take a look at the competitors’ websites and social media accounts to see how they are representing themselves online and how they are interacting with customers.Reputation. Look into the public reputation of the competitors by reading online reviews and considering any awards they may have received.Analyze the competitors’ strengths and weaknessesSWOT analysis. Conduct a good old SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis of the competitors to identify their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. This will help me understand the competitive landscape and how I can position my product to take advantage of opportunities and mitigate threats.Look for weaknesses. Look for areas where the competitors may be lacking, such as a limited product line, poor customer service, or a weak online presence. These can be potential areas for me to focus on and differentiate my product from them.Determine their competitive advantage. Consider what makes the competitors’ products or services unique or particularly appealing to customers, as well as any competitive advantage they may have in terms of pricing, distribution, or other factors.Develop a strategyIf the following steps ring a bell for you, that’s not a coincidence. If you’ve heard of Go-To-Market strategy (GTM) that’s why this sounds familiar. Introduction to GTM is not part of this post, maybe another time, but I am not an expert of GTM at all, but let’s just give a hint: A Go-To-Market strategy is a plan for introducing a new product or service to the market and making it successful. But let’s come back to my list I pay attention to in this phase:Target customers. Consider the target customers of the competitors. That is the easiest. Since at this point I know a lot about them. It is natural to “attract away” some customers from the competition. I know my key differentiators so I just need to communicate them to the crowd. I choose a segment considering demographics, needs, and preferences and constructing some marketing messages and channels often times similar to what they use to reach their customers.Choose the Go-To-Market channels. I decide how I will reach the target market, including which channels I will use to promote and sell my product. This may include online channels such as the product’s website or social media accounts, or even physical events!!!Marketing plan. I create a plan for promoting the product to the target market, including tactics such as advertising, content marketing, social media marketing, and in theory public relations (never did actually, just planned :D)Pricing strategy. Decide on a pricing strategy that must be competitive while still profitable. Consider factors such as the target market, the value of the product, and the prices of the competitors. To be frank there are multiple types of pricing like cost based, competitor based, or value based. I tend to apply value based whenever is possible since at this point I more or less see how much value the product can provide for the customers and it can be much more profitable than any other pricing strategy.Create a sales plan. I try to develop a plan for how I will sell the product. I try to develop a process for reaching and closing deals with potential customers. I have the least experience in the sales planning to be honest, because either I had a sales team in the company so they already knew what to do so we just aligned or there was no sales team, but those products were not blockbusters. There is definitely room for improvement for me here.Measure and optimize the strategy. I regularly track the progress and performance, and make adjustments to the strategy as needed.Competitor analysis is an ongoing process. I regularly review and update my analysis as the competitors change and my business also hopefully evolves. As you see this can be quite a big task for us product managers. And this is only one tiny part of our everyday life, so the time constraint will kick in most probably. I don’t have a solution for that either, I struggle with that just as (probably) you. There are parts which I sometimes skip from the above tasks to speed up a bit and the more I do these the more I become more efficient.Be cool, stay tuned!GtmGo To MarketGo To Market StrategyProduct ManagementCompetitor Analysis----More from JzfdvdFollowLove podcasts or audiobooks?

Without conducting discovery on a regular basis, product teams are will literally be in the dark regarding the types of issues & problems that customers face on a daily basis, which will lead to them not knowing what they should and should not build in terms of introducing a new feature for their product or solving long standing issues faced by customers.As such, having a simple method of capturing key information which is important for determining what should be built next based on the ideas, issues or problems faced by customers when using the product. This article will identify the types of data every product manager should be capturing from customers during their discovery run, and how they should be analysed, categorised and dissected to provide the best direction and perspective on what your team should be building next.Include both qualitative and quantitative data pointsPhoto by Stephen Phillips - Hostreviews.co.uk on UnsplashData points from customers come in two types:Quantitative: These are raw numbers, statistics, ratios, percentages etc. which help inform you, on the numerical side of things, how your product and company are performing.Qualitative: These are customer conversations, written responses to feedback forms or discussions held with external stakeholders that help you understand how customers use or feel when using the product.As a product manager, it’s important that you not only take into account any form of analytics that you are tracking but to also pair up analytics with real world accounts, experiences and feedback from real customers who are using your product on a day to day basis.Quantitative data, when used correctly, can only point towards the symptoms of something bad or interesting occurring with your product (e.g. a 5% drop in MAU). In order to truly understand why quantitative data is showing those symptoms, you’ll need to reach out to customers to have frank conversations with them as to why these data points are occurring.Below are some good data gathering methods that I’ve covered previously:When interviewing customers, using the Five Whys method to determine the root cause of the issue or problem faced by the customer.Analyse Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and the associated feedback to determine what is causing customer happiness to increase or decrease on a month-by-month basis.Use the Importance & Satisfaction framework to identify which features to introduce or issues to solve first that would help you provide the most customer benefit in the short to long term.Include your assumptions about customer behaviours, problems or issuesPhoto by Anthony Tran on UnsplashBefore heading into any discovery run, it is important that you and your team have rolling discussions about the assumptions you might have regarding any issues that the customer faces or the new feature you might want to validate during conversations with said customers. In this case, assumptions mean what you and your team believe is the reason for why the customer wants the issue to be resolved or the solution that the customer hopes to use by releasing a new feature.As a product manager, it is important that you are able to formulate your own high level assumptions about the state of things. This does not mean that you need to generate new ideas on a whim or have an all-encompassing solution to the issue, problem or idea that is being faced or proposed by the customer. It means that you must have a list of ‘hunches’ or ‘gut feels’ about why the product is doing what it’s doing at the moment, why that might be causing problems for the customers and why you want to be validating those assumptions during this discovery run.When listing out assumptions, you could list it out in a table in the following format:Assumptions, Findings and Vision Alignment tableAssumptions: This is where you want to be including your assumptions about the problems that the customer is facing, which is what you want to validate with the customer as you conduct discovery. E.g. your discovery run might be around using multi-factor authentication when logging into your product. One of your assumptions here can be that, “The reason why users want multi-factor authentication is to increase the security of their product”.Findings: This is where you summarise what you’ve discussed, heard and noted down from your conversations and discussions with the customer. You want it right next to assumptions so you can easily see if your summarised finding matches up with the assumption you made before conducting your discovery runAre assumptions and findings aligned?: This is where you either say YES or NO when comparing your ‘Assumptions’ and ‘Findings’ columns, as to whether both assumptions and findings are correlated or not. If they are not matching, then provide a short explanation as to why your finding invalidated your assumption.Vision: This is where you match up your finding with the product vision. This is to ensure that you and your team are not only working on real problems faced by customers, but that those problems are fully aligned with the direction that your product is heading in via the product vision. For more info on product vision, please read hereAre findings and vision aligned?: Again, this is where you declare YES or NO when comparing your ‘Findings’ and ‘Vision’ columns, as to whether your findings are aligned with the product vision that you are trying to achieve.Undertake competitor analysis on what they might be doing in this space to solve the issue or introducing new ideasPhoto by Chris Chow on UnsplashFinally, in every discovery run, the issues, problems, features and ideas that you are setting out to validate usually never occurs in a vacuum. Some — if not most — of the time, the problems would be solved or the feature would exist via your product’s close competitors. These solved problems or key features could be much more refined and robust for your competitors, which may cause your existing user base to ditch your product and migrate over to theirs instead, as they might be more well suited for their needs and pain points.As a product manager, you should be well aware of what your competitors are doing in the same space as you are, as well as their advantages and disadvantages they might have over your product. You might want to conduct your competitor analysis in the following way:Competitor Analysis tableUsing the following table, you will not only be able to identify who your competitors are but also what are their distinguishing points from your product and whether that is better or worse than what you might be offering.ConclusionFollow the tips below and you’ll be well-prepared for your first discovery run in no time!

Insights From My First Year in Product… | by Tinsae Erkailo | Dec, 2022 | MediumTinsae ErkailoFollowDec 26·5 min readThe 5 Arts of Product ManagementInsights From My First Year in Product ManagementWho would have thought that just one year ago, I was happily settled in a different job, surrounded by wonderful coworkers and meaningful challenges? I never dreamed of becoming a product manager. But, as they say, when opportunity knocks, you gotta answer! And when I was offered the chance to create a product that I would have loved to use in my old role, I just couldn’t pass it up. Of course, I was excited about the opportunity, but I was also a bit nervous about leaving a job that had been such a great fit for me, especially during such unpredictable times (thanks, COVID).At the time, I had a manager who really cared about me as a person, not just as a worker bee. They were always interested in my goals, dreams, and hobbies, which made me feel comfortable enough to talk to them about this new opportunity that had come up. I was a little nervous and unsure, but they listened patiently and helped me see that any big challenge comes with some anxiety, and that’s completely normal. They reminded me that it’s important to push myself and try new things that will help me grow. Although they were sad to see me go, they knew this was a great opportunity for me, so I took the plunge and jumped into the unknown. And here I am, still soaring (or at least trying to)!So why am I sharing all this with you? First of all, I wanted to give some background on how I ended up where I am today. But also, I wanted to send a little love letter to my old manager: you helped me take a risk that I haven’t regretted for a second. In fact, I love it! Thank you ❤️ This just goes to show the immense value of a good (no, make that great) people manager. As Arsène Wenger put it“I believe one of the best things about managing people is that we can influence lives in a positive way. That’s basically what a manager is about.Okay, okay, back to the topic at hand: product management. Wow, what a wild ride my first year has been! I’ve learned so much, but there are a few key “arts” that have really stood out for me: communication, collaboration, action, curiosity, and consciousness. These ideas have been invaluable in helping me thrive in this challenging field, and I want to share them with anyone else who’s looking to take the same leap I did.Communication 💬As a product manager, you’re the glue that keeps your team together. And what makes that glue extra sticky? Communication, communication, communication. It’s the foundation of success in this role. Without clear communication, it’s easy for initiatives to go off the rails and for team members to lose motivation. It’s up to you to make sure everyone is on the same page, working towards the same goals, and rowing in the same direction. That means you need top-notch verbal and written communication skills, and the ability to tailor your message to different audiences. So don’t forget to keep practicing and adapting your communication skills to fit the needs of your team and audience. After all, it’s not just about getting the job done — it’s about doing it with flair and finesse.Collaboration 🤝The saying goes, “There’s no ‘I’ in team,” and as a product manager, it’s crucial to remember this. The best products are the result of everyone working together and supporting each other, so it’s important that you know how to play nice with others. That means fostering collaboration and ensuring your team has the tools and resources they need to succeed. And in return, they’ll support you and help you do your job better.Action 👷‍♂️It’s not enough to just talk the talk — you’ve got to walk the walk too. That means being decisive and taking action. It can be easy to get lost in a sea of meetings and discussions, but at the end of the day, what really counts is what you actually do. So, don’t be afraid to roll up your sleeves and get things done. Whether it’s making tough decisions or taking the lead on initiatives, it’s up to you to make things happen. After all, talk is cheap — it’s the actions you take that truly make a difference.Curiosity 🤔Curiosity may have killed the cat, but for product managers, it’s an essential ingredient for success. After all, the best products come from a never-ending desire to learn, explore, and innovate. So, don’t be afraid to ask questions, seek out new perspectives, and challenge your assumptions. Always be curious and never stop looking for new opportunities to improve your products and grow your business. Curiosity should be your middle name :)Consciousness 🧘‍♂️Finally, cultivate consciousness. To navigate the challenges of product management, you need to develop the inner strength to cope and grow. The more aware you are of your own needs, the better equipped you’ll be to handle the challenges of the job and come out stronger on the other side. Whether it’s managing stress and uncertainty, dealing with setbacks and failures, or staying focused and disciplined, being conscious is crucial for your success and endurance.At this point, you might think, “Tinsae, these ideas are basic — nothing earth-shattering here.” And you’d be right — they are indeed basic. But here’s the thing: while most of us excel at abstract, intellectual concepts, it’s the emotional, interpersonal stuff that tends to trip us up. Things like showing genuine interest in others, considering their wants and needs, and understanding their perspectives. These may seem like “simple”, no-brainer concepts, but they’re diametrically opposed to the abstruse and complex things we spend most of our time getting good at. And yet, it’s these simple things that enable us to build strong and positive relationships with the people around us. So, don’t underestimate the power of these simple acts — they may be simple, but they can so often be the remedy to a lot of the pain-points in your personal and professional life.I hope that was helpful. If you think I can be of further assistance on your journey, especially if you’re a person of color, feel free to shoot me an invite on LinkedIn and let’s connect and chat. And now, it’s time for me to hop on a packed train and make my way up to Massachusetts, the unlikeliest of places for some of the best Ethiopian food you’ll ever taste.Until next time 👋Product ManagementYoung ProfessionalsPersonal Development----More from Tinsae ErkailoFollowLove podcasts or audiobooks?

To be successful, product managers need to have a strong understanding of their target audience, the competitive landscape, and the various tools and techniques available to them to help drive product development and growth.Here are some of the top tools and techniques for product management that can help boost your productivity and efficiency:Product roadmap: A product roadmap is a high-level visual representation of the planned development and delivery of a product. It helps product managers align teams and stakeholders around a shared vision and provides a clear overview of the product’s direction and priorities.Customer feedback and user research: Gathering feedback from customers and conducting user research can provide valuable insights into the needs and preferences of your target audience. This can help product managers make informed decisions about what features to include in their product and how to improve the user experience.Project management software: Project management software, such as Asana or Trello, can help product managers track progress, assign tasks, and collaborate with team members. These tools can also provide real-time updates and alerts, ensuring that everyone is on the same page and that tasks are completed on time.Prototyping and wireframing tools: Prototyping and wireframing tools, such as Figma or InVision, can help product managers quickly and easily create visual representations of their product ideas. This can be especially useful for communicating concepts to team members or stakeholders and getting feedback on design and functionality.Data analysis and tracking: Product managers need to be able to track key metrics, such as user engagement and product usage, to measure the success of their product. Tools like Google Analytics or Mixpanel can help product managers track and analyze data to identify trends and areas for improvement.Photo by Kelly Sikkema on UnsplashWant to dive deep?In addition to the tools and techniques mentioned in the previous section, there are several other strategies that product managers can use to boost their productivity and efficiency. These include:Product vision and strategy: A clear product vision and strategy are essential for guiding product development and decision-making. It helps product managers understand the overall direction and goals of the product and align teams and stakeholders around a shared vision.Agile methodologies: Agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, can help product managers manage and prioritize work, adapt to change, and deliver value to customers in short increments. These approaches can also help product managers get feedback and make course corrections more quickly.Collaboration and communication: Effective collaboration and communication are crucial for product management success. Tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams can help product managers stay in touch with team members, stakeholders, and customers, ensuring that everyone is informed and aligned.User stories: User stories are short, concise descriptions of a feature or functionality from the perspective of a user. They can help product managers understand the needs and preferences of their customers and prioritize features for development.Product analytics: Product analytics tools, such as Amplitude or Heap, can help product managers track and analyze product usage and engagement to identify trends, optimize features, and improve the user experience.By leveraging these tools and techniques, product managers can better manage the complexity of their products, stay aligned with their customers, and drive product development and growth.Photo by Kyle Glenn on UnsplashIn conclusion, product management requires a combination of strategic thinking, project management skills, and the ability to leverage the right tools and techniques to drive product development and growth.

Here are the 5 steps I wish knew earlier for how to get novel insights from user interviews:1. Discuss as a team: What do you need to learn?Be honest with yourself about where you are.All too often we narrow down prematurely, because we assume which user pains are most urgent. Whether we’re working on a new startup or on a mature product, we must be honest about our evidence or lack thereof.Discuss these questions as a team:What are known facts?What are assumptions?What are blind spots?2. Write an interview scriptWhy not just improvise? After all, the overhead of writing an interview script may seem wasteful.Interview scripts are helpful because they:Keep us focused on our knowledge gapsEnsure a natural sequence of questionsCatch poorly formulated questions earlyBesides, spending 15–30 minutes on an interview script to get twice the insight from each interview is a no-brainer time investment.What, then, goes in the interview script?Set the contextPut the interviewee at ease:Thank them for their timeBriefly introduce what you’re working onRemind the interviewee that no answer is right or wrongLet them know that their answers are confidentialConsider asking to record the interviewStart broadAsk questions like:What is your background?Can you tell me about what you do in your current role?How do you perform this task?Get into specificsValuable insights are non-obvious, and the non-obvious lies in the specifics.Don’t ask: “How do you make new hires?”Instead, ask: “Tell me about the last time you made a hire?”Why? Because a generic question will give you a generic answer. For example, you might hear: “I define job requirements together with HR, then put out a job posting, screen resumes, interview candidates, and then decide.” And that’s useless. It’s too obvious.If you ask about the last time the interviewee made a hire, you can uncover the specific challenges of defining job requirements for that particular role and the specific hurdles of assessing those applicants. What’s more, you can uncover how the interviewee felt at each step.Use proven questionsThese questions often work well:Walk me through the last time you…What is most challenging about this?What is most time-consuming in this process?What motivates you to do this?If you had a magic wand to simplify this, what would you wish for?End with demographic infoYou want to know if some subgroups of users have problems in common. For example, recent college grads have different challenges than experienced professionals looking for a new job.But why not start the interview with questions about demographics? Because demographic questions are closed-ended, and at the beginning of the interview, you want to open up the conversation.3. Schedule interviewsKeep in mind:Schedule interviews before you need them because it can take days or weeks before the interviewee is freeTell interviewees what’s in it for them. A chance to shape the product? A gift card? A free research report based on dozens of interviews you conduct?If it’s hard to get 45–60 minutes of someone’s time, try asking for 15–30 minutes. You can learn a lot in a short amount of time4. Conduct each interviewWith interviews scheduled and an interview script in hand, it’s time to conduct each interview.Bring along a team memberAnd don’t just default to bringing along a designer or a product manager. Why not bring a developer? You want the entire team to build user empathy. Besides, developers often see things you don’t see, so you’re better together.Build rapportHelp the interviewee feel comfortable. You want them to share candidly. They may even offer a follow-up interview.Listen for feelingsWhat makes the interviewee feel frustrated? Angry? Excited? The most valuable insights are related to feelings.Gold might glitter at the last minuteAs you near the end, ask “Anything else you’d want to share?” I’m amazed at how often interviewees share golden nuggets then.Take detailed notes or record the interviewGet quotes. And numbers. These specifics are perfect when you want to convey evidence of a user problem to others.5. Follow up after the interviewSend a thank you noteInclude any follow-ups from the interview. Ask if they can introduce you to someone else to interview, so you build your interview funnel.Organize the notes in your team folderI have used a database in Notion for user interviews, where I link notes from user interviews to specific personas.Share a TL;DR with your teamYour team’s busy and often won’t (and shouldn’t) read all the raw interview notes. Make it easy for them by sharing the three most important insights from the interview.Common pitfallsFailing to update the interview scriptThe interview script is there to help you, not to check a box. Modify the script as you learn from each interview, so you get the most out of the subsequent interviews.Asking long, complicated questionsShort questions work better than longwinded ones. And asking a single question at a time works better than asking multiple at once.Don’t ask: “How do you recruit new hires and what is hard about it?”Instead ask: “How do you recruit new hires?”Asking leading questionsWe come into interviews with our own biases. But try not to bring that bias into the questions. For example, avoid asking “How big of a problem is it that you don’t know what salary to expect when applying for a job?” if the interviewee hasn’t even mentioned that problem.Instead, ask open-ended questions, and listen to see if the responses confirm or disconfirm your hypotheses.And if nothing else: Remember that speaking with users is 10x better than building in isolation.Product ManagementDesignUser ResearchEntrepreneurshipTeamwork----More from Product CoalitionFollowThe world's largest independent Product Management community. 1m+ readers. 17,000 podcast downloads. 3,500+ articles. 7,000+ Slack members.
